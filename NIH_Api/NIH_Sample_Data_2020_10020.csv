DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
This Research Training Grant renewal application is an extensively revised resubmission of our initial proposal to support cross-disciplinary and comprehensive dental science research training at the School of Dentistry at the University of Washington. The application constitutes the competing renewal of the former Oral Biology-Salivary Research Training and the Bacterially Induced Chronic Inflammation Research Training grants. The revised application consists of a single research training facility and program, focused on using molecular and cell biology and bioengineering approaches to study the basic biology of the oral tissues and their reactions to microbial pathogens and inert materials. The Program is administered by a Program Coordinator, and directed by a Program Oversight Committee. The collaborating Training Faculty include individuals from the Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Public Health and the Department of Bioengineering; and are organized into 12 groups based on research interests. The proposed training program consists of two phases: 1) All trainees will receive coursework in the major competency areas cited in the PA including: genomics, molecular biology and molecular epidemiology, gene-mediated diagnosis and therapeutics, cell biology, bioinformatics, biomaterials, biomimetics, nanotechnology, tissue engineering and bioimaging technology. Coursework will also include experimental design and data analysis, and dental sciences. PhD students will receive the most training; MS and short-term trainees will receive less. 2) All trainees will learn to perform biological experiments using molecular and cell biology and/or bioengineering approaches by designing and performing experiments under the direction of a Research Mentor chosen from the proposed training faculty. A total of 12.75 training positions are requested, of which 6 are postdoctoral and 5 are predoctoral long term positions, 1.5 are short term positions for dental students, and 0.25 are short term positions for new and midcareer dental school faculty. Although long term trainees may elect to matriculate in a PhD or MS (dentists only) programs in 6 departments, Oral Biology and Bioengineering are expected to have highest enrollments. Courses to be taken in conjunction with this training are described in some detail.",Cross-Disciplinary Dental Science Research Training,,Kenneth T Izutsu,1877343

Training Program at the University of California, San Diego is currently in its
25th year. This program is the foundation of the Ph.D. training effort in the
biological sciences at UCSD, as it supports the very best graduate students
from the Biology-Salk and Chemistry-Biochemistry Ph.D. programs. The mission of
the CMG Training Program is to provide rigorous basic research training in cell
biology, molecular biology, and genetics to outstanding young biomedical
researchers in the earlier years of their doctoral studies. Specific emphasis
is placed upon the creativity, quality, and impact of the research, the ethical
conduct of research, the achievement of racial diversity among biomedical
researchers, the ability of the trainees to communicate their results
effectively, and the promotion of cooperation and collaboration among
scientists.  While the new director has already made an impressive
impact and demonstrates significant potential for leading this program to a
greater level of accomplishment, more time is needed to correct the weaknesses
mentioned above. Thus, funding for three years at the current slot level is
recommended to provide for a timelier reassessment of progress.
The CMG Program Director is Dr. Jim Kadonaga. He has been a member of the
Biology Department/Division at UCSD since 1988, and is currently Professor and
Vice Chair of the Molecular Biology Section. Dr. Kadonaga works with an
Advisory Committee for the CMG Training Program that consists of Drs. Lorraine
Pillus, Steve Wasserman, Bart Sefton, Elizabeth Komives, and Bill McGinnis.
There are currently 98 training faculty from the UCSD Division of Biology, Salk
Institute, UCSD Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Department of
Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the UCSD Medical School. The CMG Training
Program provides support for 45 outstanding Ph.D. students that are selected
from a five-fold larger pool of eligible students (currently, 224 eligible
students). The trainees fulfill the general requirements of their respective
graduate programs and additionally participate in CMG-specific training
activities, which include biannual CMG Training Program Symposia, annual
One-on-One Conferences with the Program Director, and CMG Career Development
Workshops. Over the past 10 years, 124 CMG trainees have successfully completed
their Ph.D. thesis. Past and present CMG trainees have contributed an enormous
wealth of fascinating and important knowledge to the biological sciences
through a total of 411 publications (not including abstracts). With the
projected growth of biology at UCSD, we envision the implementation of an even
stronger CMG Training Program over the next five years.","Cell, Molecular and Genetics Training Program",,Randolph Y. Hampton,1924909

Much of this success can be attributed to 25 years of funding of the Cardiovascular Training Program Grant.  This application is a competitive renewal for our Cardiovascular Training Program Grant, which was last funded in 1996.  The cardiovascular training program represents the integrated efforts of the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, Cell Biology, Pediatrics, Pharmacology, Engineering, and Genetics to train postdoctoral cardiovascular physician-scientists.  This will be accomplished by providing a multidisciplinary faculty and environment to trainees in order to foster and develop excellence in biomedical research related to the cardiovascular system.  The underlying philosophy of this program will be to integrate training and research by creating an environment that facilitates the natural linkages among programs and departments throughout the University.  An extended period of research (2 years or more) will be provided to trainees under the mentorship of program faculty who will closely supervise and direct the academic career development of the trainee.  This program will provide an important mechanism for supporting trainees during a critical period of postgraduate medical training and provide an environment conducive to a research-oriented career.  During this time, trainees will be ""protected"" from clinical responsibilities and immersed in research to obtain the background and experience necessary to establish themselves an independent investigators in academic institutions.  The individual mentor will provide skills such as experimental design, data analysis, and manuscript and grant preparation during the training period. The goal of this program is to continue this history of productivity by creating an environment that will ensure that Duke will continue to contribute to the development of young investigators capable of pursuing successful research careers in cardiovascular fields.  The current application will describe the modifications and improvements that have been recently implemented and will discuss Duke""s ongoing commitment to train the next generation of cardiovascular researchers.  The training program emphasizes the training of physician-scientists, and to this end, approximately 90% of the trainees will be MDs or MD/PhDs.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Medical Scientist Training Program at Yale is designed to train physician-scientists who will translate basic and clinical research to problems of human pathobiology. About 12 students each year enter our MSTP and make up -12% of the medical school class. The strength of our Program is the flexibility of the Yale System of medical education and the breadth and depth of the graduate programs at Yale. These programs of medical and graduate education allow MSTP students to customize their educational paths. Graduate training at Yale provide students with opportunities in many biomedical tracks including Cell Biology, Physiology, Genetics, Immunology, Microbiology, Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry, Neuroscience, Pharmacology, Molecular Cellular & Developmental Biology, and Chemistry. We accommodate students in nontraditional areas such as epidemiology and public health, psychology, computer sciences, sociology and anthropology. New programs in Translational Research (e.g... Clinical Immunology and Cancer Biology), and in Biomedical Engineering provide new opportunities for MSTP students. The Program requires ~8 years to complete but emphasizes interdisciplinary training and correlation with clinical disciplines. Students spend the first two years studying basic sciences of which some courses can be taken for graduate school credit. Clinical medicine is introduced in the 2nd year and emphasizes systems approaches to disease. All students complete 6 months of clerkships in medicine, pads and psychiatry before beginning thesis work. This prepares them for participation in weekly longitudinal clinics in ambulatory medicine, designed for MSTP students during the research years. Students are thus able to relate research training to clinical medicine without compromising lab time. Approximately 74% of our graduates now in academic positions are in clinical departments while 26% are in basic science departments. Our goal of preparing physician-scientists for academic careers has been successful in that -90% of our graduates have peer reviewed research grants. Over the past 36 years the Program has been in existence, > 8,000 publications in top journals have appeared.   
  
RELEVANCE: Basic and translational/clinical research form the basis for all advances in health. We are now at a crossroads in basic science with our understanding of the human genome and our ability to decipher the cellular and molecular basis of normal and pathophysiological processes, and design rational approaches to alleviating disease. The future of medicine depends on the marriage of basic and clinical disciplines: MSTP nhvsician-scienti.sts will lead these endeavors.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The program trains physician-scientists and post-doctoral PhD scientists in aspects of the pathophysiological processes that occur after traumatic injury and critical illness. Over the past 4 years we have successfully recruited to fill our positions and have addressed a key concern that was raised in our previous competitive renewal regarding diversity in our program. We have paid particular attention to identifying and recruiting strong under-represented minority candidates.  Our previous competitive renewal also focused upon the ""key initiatives"", defined by the leaders at the National Institutes of Health and termed the ""NIH Roadmap"". This had direct bearing on the structure and direction of this training program. Briefly, the key initiatives or themes are: (1) New Pathways to Discovery, (2) Research Teams of the Future and (3) Reengineering the Clinical Research Enterprise. We propose to continue to educate trainees in established molecular biology techniques and will expand their training to include cutting edge research and analysis (i.e. biomedical computing) techniques. Through collaborations with basic scientists and integration with the available research education programs at the University of Washington, we will expose trainees to broad-based research teams and programs. Trainee education and experience will continue to include concepts of translational research, whereby basic observations will be evaluated as potential diagnostic and therapeutic benefit for critically ill patients.  In summary, we aim to prepare a diverse group of interested scientists for academic careers as independent investigators and educators. Through a multidisciplinary and collaborative effort, trainees learn how to identify important research questions, how to design, conduct and analyze experiments that will address these questions and how to translate their findings into clinically relevant interventions. RELEVANCE:  Trauma remains an important public health problem. Injuries are responsible for a high proportion of deaths in people of all ages and medical care for injury victims is costly. Our training program has successfully educated surgeons, physicians and post-doctoral students in aspects of the applied biology of injury and inflammation. Graduates from our program have demonstrated a commitment to understanding the biology of injury and to the care of critically ill injury victims.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application requests continuing support for a successful interdisciplinary program in Cellular and Molecular Biology at Washington University in St. Louis. The mission of the program is to provide interdisciplinary training to graduate students from four distinct yet related fields of cell and molecular biology (Developmental Biology, Genetics, Cell Biology, and Microbiology). Our program is highly integrated and introduces students to the core concepts and methods of cell and molecular biology. It has an organizational structure specifically designed to foster student and faculty interactions that span programmatic and departmental boundaries, to maintain effective communication and cooperation among the faculty and steering committees of four individual doctoral programs, and to oversee a centralized admissions process. In this renewal, we are implementing three training grant-specific activities to foster a group identity among training grant-supported students: a student-hosted research seminar, a series of sponsored lunches for first- and second-year students, and a set of first-year student talks. We identify students for support based on eight parameters and support them for their first three years because this is when they are most involved in the unifying didactic components of the program. In addition, by supporting students in their first year, we supplement university funds and are able to matriculate more students than would otherwise be possible. We have successfully continued our efforts at recruiting students from under-represented groups in science and disadvantaged backgrounds, and are expanding these efforts to include students with disabilities. The Cellular and Molecular Biology Training Grant itself serves as a powerful unifying force that interconnects students and faculty from all four programs around the shared responsibility of graduate training. And, our graduate training program seeks to enable our students to pursue careers at the vanguard of scientific research and education by helping them to establish a broad-based scientific foundation of knowledge and network of colleagues as they initiate their scientific career.  
  
",Training Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology," 8. Public Health Relevance Statement Most human diseases arise due to disruptions in basic cellular and molecular processes caused by mutations in one's own DNA or the presence of a pathogen in one's body. Our program trains students in the core concepts and methods of cell and molecular biology, and thus provides them with the knowledge and skills required to identify the molecular basis of, and develop more effective treatments for, human disease.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Training Program in Transfusion Medicine and Hematology is to provide research training in transfusion medicine and the scientific disciplines related to Hematology in order to develop academically oriented physician-scientists and nonphysician scientists with expertise in the performance of both basic and clinical research. Upon completion of this program, each trainee will be qualified to assume a medical school faculty position and conduct an independent program of clinical or laboratory investigation in one of the fields of study included in this program, including Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine (Track I); Hemoglobin, Hematopoiesis and Cellular Therapy (Track II); Coagulation and Thrombosis (Track III); and Molecular Biology, Molecular Signaling, and Genetics (Track IV). In each of these tracks, exposure to the clinical aspects of the area selected (comprising less than 20 per cent of the total trainee time during the tenure of this fellowship) will be provided to permit the trainee to understand the clinical context in which the research which he or she is to undertake is placed. The remainder of the time (at least 80%) will be spent in a defined tutorial research program with a preceptor in one of the laboratories or clinical investigation areas described in this grant proposal. The trainees in all tracks will also take part in an inter- and intradepartmental didactic program, including both standardized curricular content as well as topical seminars and conferences. Each trainee will be expected to report orally and in writing on the research being performed at regular intervals. The trainee will also be encouraged to take additional course work at Duke University it that will enhance his/her ability to achieve satisfactory completion of his/her work. Trainees in areas of clinical investigation will be encouraged to pursue a masters in health sciences in clinical research degree granted by the Duke University Clinical Research Training Program; at a minimum, they will be expected to complete an introductory course in statistics and attend the training program's own course in clinical investigation. The training program funded by this award will be offered to qualified persons holding either the M.D. or Ph.D. degree with interests in research training in transfusion medicine and hematology; at least one trainee will be recruited specifically into the field of genomics and hemoglobinopathies. Persons from minority groups and women will be encouraged to enter the program. No predoctoral or primarily clinical competence training will be funded by this grant. The facilities for research training will be based at the various research laboratories and clinics of Duke University and the allied Veterans' Administration Medical Centers in Durham, North Carolina. Fulfillment of the training goals of this program will meet present and future needs for scientists and physician-scientists who can conduct high caliber research in both basic and clinical sciences related to transfusion medicine and hematology and who can translate the rapidly growing knowledge in these fields to improvements in the care of patients with hematologic disorders and other conditions requiring blood product and stem cell therapy.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is committed to training the next generation of scholars and leaders in the biomedical sciences by providing students with access to the very best resources of the University of Chicago. Chicago's distinctive interdisciplinary approach encourages students to explore their medical and research interests in the broadest possible terms in medicine, biology, the social sciences and the physical sciences. The University of Chicago was among the first schools to obtain federal funding in 1967 for a MSTP. Currently, we are in our 45th year of uninterrupted funding and have graduated 255 physician scientists. Our trainees have made many fundamental contributions to our understanding of biology and human disease resulting in numerous papers in Nature, Science, Cell, Immunity and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Our graduates have gone on to lead important departments and academic units including the MSTPs at UCSF, Stanford, Harvard and Emory. Two of our trainees have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Currently 57 individuals, from all over the country, are enrolled in the program of which 37% are women and 7% are URMs. However, we have initiated several programs to enhance diversity and 3 of our 11 incoming students, or 27%, are URMs. In 2012, we had a large applicant pool of 438 students from which we successfully recruited students of outstanding academic promise. Therefore, we are requesting 35 NIH-supported trainee slots for years 39-43. This level of support, in conjunction with substantial and ongoing support from the University of Chicago Biological Sciences Division, will ensure that at least 10% of the total incoming Pritzker Medical School Class are trained as physician scientists. Relative to our institutional support, the requested NIH investment would be reasonable, constituting only 27% of our anticipated budget. Since the last funding submission in 2009, significant changes in the University of Chicago MSTP have been implemented. This proposal details how the MSTP administration has been completely overhauled to improve student recruitment, mentoring and student involvement in governance. As described, several new initiates have been undertaken to enhance the rigor and productivity of graduate training, fully integrate the graduate and medical school curriculums, lessen the time to degree and to enhance both the recruitment and retention of URMs. We also provide compelling and detailed evidence on the superb quality of our students and the outstanding research environment at The University of Chicago that is uniquely configured to support interdisciplinary programs such as the MSTP.   
   
",Medical Scientist National Research Service Award,"PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The University of Chicago Medical Scientist Training Program is designed for students who wish to pursue broad careers in research relevant to human health and disease. Overall, the MSTP seeks to fulfill a national need for individuals who will apply clinical and research experience to biomedical investigation and will catalyze the application of multidisciplinary approaches to solve the most pressing problems in medical science. The Medical Scientist Training Program is committed to training the next generation of scholars and leaders in the biomedical sciences by providing students with access to the very best resources of the University of Chicago. Chicago's distinctive interdisciplinary approach encourages students to explore their medical and research interests in the broadest possible terms in medicine, biology, and the physical sciences.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The breadth of interdisciplinary research teams is expanding dramatically. At the intersection of environment and health, in particular, teams increasingly need strong grounding in basic biology and genetics while at the same time need increasingly sophisticated analyses of disease models. Only then will they be prepared to study the interaction of susceptibility genes with environmental exposures. For that reason we have adopted the approach that the modern trainee cannot be expected to do it all; rather, to succeed he or she will need to be prepared with the strongest possible disciplinary foundation together with the tools needed to work effectively with others outside their own discipline. From a large and talented pool of applicants, we select outstanding BS and DVM trainees who seek the PhD or ScD degree, and outstanding PhD, MD, and DVM trainees who make a 3-year commitment to postdoctoral training in interdisciplinary pulmonary sciences. Trainees with backgrounds in biology, medicine, engineering, and physics work side-by-side on problems at the intersection of pulmonary sciences and environmental exposures. These trainees benefit from working with each other, working with trainees not supported by this T32, and working with a well-funded interdisciplinary faculty. This faculty addresses three main problems: air pollution, lung infection, and asthma. The theme of pulmonary inflammation spans these foci. Another theme is a strong emphasis on engineering and physical sciences. Bridging the gap between the life sciences and the physical / engineering sciences has been a longstanding goal of our program. These themes foster exceptional levels of collaboration among a faculty with unusually diverse expertise and interests. They form the faculty into a cohesive interdisciplinary team elucidating basic mechanisms of lung disease. Our Program offers access to excellent facilities and unique nanotechnologies, and is designed so that trainees will: 1) master modern technologies of cell and molecular biology as well as integrative physiology; 2) learn the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, 3) design experiments effectively and interpret data critically, 4) adapt well to change, and 5) build successful careers as responsible members of the scientific community. In the past 34 years of our T32 we have never had an unfilled slot. In the past 10 years of our T32, 6 of our trainees were underrepresented minorities and 27 have completed training. 25 are currently working in science, including 7 in industry and 18 in academia at the rank of assistant professor or higher.

The Training Faculty numbers 33 senior investigators from six University departments (Medicine, Pediatrics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Human Genetics, Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology, Pathology) who carry out a broad range of endocrine-related research supported by a substantial base of NIH and other peer reviewed research grants. Each training faculty member is an established investigator. In addition to the training faculty, the program is aided by the participation of 21 Senior and 12 Associate Faculty from the Departments of Medicine, Pediatrics, Ob/Gyn and Health Studies. These faculty make important contributions to the training experience by providing training in clinical endocrinology and clinical research or statistical analysis of data. Trainees are selected on the basis of prior individual accomplishments including prior research training and experience as well as commitment to an academic research career. Trainees select a faculty preceptor(s) and the trainee and preceptor jointly identify a research project. Trainees then undergo at least 3 years of training in the research laboratory of the preceptor during which time trainees assume a progressively greater responsibility for developing research hypotheses, designing experiments, analyzing the data and preparing abstracts and scientific manuscripts. In the final year of training, an area of research is identified which is sufficiently different from the research of the preceptor to allow the trainee to submit an independent research grant proposal. This research training occurs within the framework of a required core curriculum consisting of courses which describe and review current research methodology and research advances as well as statistical analysis of research data. As a result of this intensive training, a substantial proportion of trainees from this program assume academic positions upon completion of their training and remain active in research.

ABSTRACT This competing continuation application builds on seven successful five-year cycles of NRSA/NHLBI supported academic and applied research training and mentoring in cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemiology at the Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina (UNC), Gillings School of Global Public Health. The goal of the program is to train innovative and effective researchers in the field of CVD epidemiology, to channel qualified scientists into a workforce capable to address the national and worldwide burden of CVD, who possess competencies that can place research at the interface between disciplines and the ability to incorporate innovation into the formulation and conduct of research. Historical strengths of the program include: engaged mentoring and numerous opportunities for active participation in research for pre- and postdoctoral trainees in environmental, behavioral, social and genetic epidemiology of CVD, subclinical atherosclerosis and community-based surveillance of CVD; integration of collaborating mentors from biostatistics, cardiology, nephrology, dental ecology, health policy, nutrition, neurology, genetics, and sociology; ongoing programmatic self-assessment and evaluation; and development of trainees from minority groups under-represented in the biomedical sciences (9 minority trainees supported in past 10 years). A process of close mentoring encourages trainees to develop individual training paths and career development models. Career development competencies and measurable outcomes are built into the yearly goals for both pre-doctoral and post-doctoral trainees. The 28 former trainees who completed predoctoral and/or postdoctoral training funded by this program since the year 2000 published 495 manuscripts (199 in first-author positions), including graduates now in academia, industry or governmental agencies. Enhancements to the program in the last five years include the promotion of peer-mentoring, the establishment of co-mentoring (a primary mentor and an associated mentor), periodic goal setting by each trainee and fellow with their mentors; and yearly evaluations of trainer and trainee. We propose to retain these components as well as introduce three new features to the training program. New elements include (1) expanded leadership structure of the program to include a Program Steering Committee, Career Development team, and Research Support team; (2) creation of an External Advisory Board; and (3) introduction of two new core research areas based on active research (vascular origins of cognitive impairment and dementia, and CVD outcomes research). We propose continuation of our four predoctoral and four postdoctoral trainees.

Project Summary
The University of Chicago Growth, Development and Disabilities MD/PhD Training Program is designed to
provide basic science and translational research training for a highly selective group of medical students in a
combined-degree program. The Program is based on the premise that a commitment to complete both the MD
and PhD degrees and to establish and maintain a research-focused career is only developed after some time
in medical school (hence no attrition from this training program since 1978). Students are chosen on the basis
of outstanding academic credentials, demonstrated ability in basic science, and devotion to pursuit of a
research-oriented career. All students fulfill the requirements of a PhD in a particular discipline and complete
the same requirements for the MD as other medical students. They are continuously and longitudinally advised
by the Program Director and staff, a Student Advisory Committee, a newly-formed External Advisory
Committee, and Mentors who have outstanding records of promoting the training, education and career
advancement of biomedical scientists. The Program has undergone a restructuring to more closely align its
training goals with the mission of NICHD to foster training in the areas of growth, development, and disabilities
research and clinical specialties in pediatrics and related areas. The overall Program, its elements, and the
participants are assessed via multiple evaluation tools through the year. The ultimate success is measured by
the impact of the trainees' thesis research, the completion of both the MD and PhD degrees, and their long-
term success as physician-scientists.",Graduate Training in Growth and Development,"PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The long-standing goal of the University of Chicago MD/PhD training program in Growth, Development and Disabilities is to train outstanding physician-scientists.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed Research Training Program will train predoctoral students broadly in the discipline of genetics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Students admitted to the Genetics graduate program at Wisconsin will be supported for two years of graduate studies: the first year and a subsequent year after completing all required coursework and qualifying examinations. The Genetics graduate program presently consists of 79 faculty representing 20 different departments in the biological sciences and 53 students studying with 28 different faculty trainers. The collective research interests of program faculty and students encompass virtually the entire breadth and depth of contemporary genetics.  Trainees are selected based on prior academic achievements, research experience, and personal interviews conducted before acceptance into the program. Accepted students identify Genetics as their primary academic pursuit and choose thesis advisors based on their individual research interests The Genetics doctoral program is a campus-wide training program administered by the Laboratory of Genetics, which is housed in a modern state-of-the-art research facility.  Supported students complete a rigorous academic program consisting of both formal coursework and individualized mentoring in genetics. Formal coursework includes a core curriculum of required genetics courses, specialized electives identified by students together with their Thesis Advisory Committee, a course in the responsible conduct of research (RCR), and continuing exposure to RCR-related issues throughout the graduate career. Students gain teaching and communication experience by serving for one semester as a Teaching Assistant for an undergraduate Genetics course and by presenting their research in formal settings before faculty and students of the program. Student performance is evaluated by a two-part qualifying examination that tests understanding of broad genetic principles and an ability to propose, execute, and defend a thesis research project. Each student's progress is monitored annually by a Thesis Advisory Committee.  The Genetics Training Grant develops young investigators as independent scientists by providing a rigorous and broad education in the science of genetics. Our graduates bring the methods and logic of genetic analysis to bear on contemporary research problems. Our long range goal is to educate new generations of professional geneticists who will advance the biological research sciences using genetic approaches and methodologies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This program has been constructed to provide a training environment that will afford trainees with all the skills needed to succeed in an academic career. This has been accomplished by assembling a critical mass of faculty with a broad range of research interests, and by creating an environment that fosters each trainees' development though intensive mentoring. The Allergy and Immunology Division is comprised of 3 full time and two part time faculty and the program in total consists of 18 faculty, including ten professors and six associate professors, 5 women and 2 minorities. These other faculty are based in Pediatric Pulmonary, Clinical Immunology and Pulmonary in the Department of Medicine, the Institute of Genetic Medicine, and the School of Public Health. The faculty are all well funded and solidly committed to this program. The program provides 3 years of balanced training in allergy and basic and clinical immunology to pediatricians, and in some cases PhD candidates. Prospective trainees are selected based on their commitment to and potential for success in an academic career. Each trainee spends the majority of his/her time in clinical, laboratory, or translational research, supplemented with course work and required clinical responsibilities. The PI/PD oversees all fellows and a single faculty member acts as preceptor for each fellow, supervising laboratory work and helping to select formal course work. Research opportunities are diverse, including clinical, laboratory, epidemiologic, and translational investigations in food allergy, asthma, and immune deficiency, as well as basic studies in both allergy and immunology. Course work includes both a core curriculum and elective courses, up to and including a Masters degree. Clinical training is outstanding and well balanced, with all of our graduates capable of caring for the world's most complicated patients. The program is based in the Division of Allergy and Immunology in the Department of Pediatrics and located in the Children's Center of The Johns Hopkins Hospital in space that was fully renovated in 2006. Space included 5 separate, fully equipped laboratories, 5 faculty offices, 3 administrative offices, a Fellows' office, a conference room equipped for teleconferencing, and offices for the division's 24 research staff.   
RELEVANCE: The importance of allergic and immunologic disease in children is enormous and growing. Allergic diseases now represent about 25% of pediatric ""sick"" visits, asthma is the leading cause of emergency admissions to the hospital, and food allergies now affect over 5% of children. The need for physicians and Ph.D.'s with expertise in both research and patient care in allergy and immunology is therefore greater than ever.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this grant is to furnish basic and clinical research training for postdoctoral renal fellows with M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degrees that wish to pursue biomedical research careers. Trainees entering our research laboratories will usually have completed a medical residency and one year of clinical nephrology. Selection for appointment is based on the aptitude of the applicant and their commitment to a career in biomedical research. Trainees are normally appointed for two years. Our program teaches a rigorous approach to scientific inquiry in basic science or/and clinical investigation. The faculty of this training program are all members of the University of Pennsylvania. Together they form a close and well-integrated collaborative entity dedicated to research training and investigation. The core basic research program emphasizes the areas of immunology/inflammation, transplantation, kidney development and structural biology, whereas the core clinical research programs focus on the epidemiology of chronic kidney disease and hypertension, and health care economics. Trainees may elect to work with investigators outside the Renal Electrolyte and Hypertension Division, as long as they are working in renal-related areas. In either scenario, cross-fertilization and development of skills to prepare trainees for a life long investigative career are emphasized. Each trainee will develop a carefully crafted research project under the close supervision of a faculty trainer. This intensively structured research experience will be supplemented by research seminars, attendance at scientific meetings, and by formal course work in molecular genetics, immunology, biochemistry, cell biology, statistics, bioethics, environmental health, radiation safety and experimental design. The Renal Research Training Committee made up of the Program Directors will carefully monitor the evolving progress of each trainee. Upon completion of this comprehensive experience, it is anticipated that each graduate will be equipped to effectively compete for further individual training support, or for independent funding at an entry-level faculty position in academic nephrology.

This proposal entitled “Training for Discovery and Scholarship in Digestive Health and Diseases” is for
continuation of a long-standing, highly successful research training program for pre- and postdoctoral
candidates and GI fellows in Digestive Health and Diseases (DHD) at the University of Chicago. This program
provides rigorous scientific training to highly qualified and promising individuals for careers in basic,
translational, and clinical investigation. It has successfully prepared generations of leaders in biomedical
research, academia, and other walks of life. The training faculty are comprised of funded, highly successful,
multidisciplinary, and collaborative investigators from the University of Chicago and its two affiliates, Argonne
National Lab and the Marine Biological Lab. A recently defined group of Associate Mentors that include early
stage investigators representing the next generation of mentors and leaders, important resource experts, or
full-time clinicians without research support, will assist full mentors. The program is strategically located in the
heart of the biomedical research complex that includes state-of-the-art research and clinical facilities. These
facilities offer technologies such as mouse genetic engineering, gnotobiotic, single cell genomics, mass
cytometry, advanced imaging, advanced `omic' technologies such as next generation DNA sequencing and
other quantitative data sciences for systems biology and integration. A robust clinical research pipeline capable
of generating highly curated clinical metadata and biospecimens for translational investigators in DHD is
available through the NIDDK P30 DDRCC. Currently, the program supports the training of two predoctoral and
five postdoctoral trainees drawn from a large pool of highly qualified candidates, particularly with the recent
influx of MD/PhD and research-intensive MDs from the Physician Scientist Development Program of the
Department of Medicine. However, with the increased demand for training in DHD, especially in the areas of
the gut microbiome, host-microbe interactions, data sciences, metabolism, immunology and IBD, we are
requesting the addition of a third pre-doctoral training position. Our DHDT32 curriculum is notable in using a
combination of didactic, formal coursework, problem-based, and hands-on training approaches that
continuously adapt to the everchanging landscape of knowledge, technology, and clinical practice to insure the
competitiveness, productivity, and success of all trainees. Their progress and career development will be
monitored closely by faculty advisory and program oversight committees. Trainees will be taught how to think
critically and creatively, and receive instruction in academic skills (e.g. grant and MS writing, etc) and the
responsible conduct of research. The program is also stepping up its efforts to promote diversity among its
selected candidates through the recent creation of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee. Collectively, these
efforts will continue to produce high quality investigators who are well prepared to become independent

The goal of this training program in environmental toxicology is to produce scientists and engineers
professionally qualified to make original contributions to improved understanding of the impacts of
environmental agents, especially hazardous chemicals, on human health. This program has supported 112
predoctoral and 94 postdoctoral Trainees since its inception in 1975. During that same time period, 356 PhD
or ScD degrees have been awarded to all students in the MIT toxicology program (Trainees plus non-
Trainees). Of our pre-doctoral and post-doctoral Trainees over the past 15 years, 8 out of 66 (12%) are in
academic positions and 42 (64%) are in industry or government, with the balance continuing in training.
Trainees pick projects from the following areas: (1) analysis of genome-, proteome- and glycome-level
responses to toxins and toxicants; (2) characterization of mutagenic responses to carcinogens as expressed
hierarchically at the genome, cell, tissue, organism and population levels of organization; (3) construction of
novel animal models for determining the effects of exposure of mammals to environmental agents; (4) systems
biology of kinase-mediated signaling cascades triggered in response to toxic agents, and during neoplastic
transformation; (5) characterization of the chemistry underlying the reaction of toxins and toxicants with cellular
macromolecules and other targets; (6) mechanistic assessment of the contribution of DNA damage to genetic
disease, and identification of the cellular defenses (e.g., DNA repair strategies) that protect against heritable
damage; (7) engineering-based design of novel model systems for evaluating responses to toxic agents; (8)
unraveling the underlying biology of environmental chemical-infectious agent interactions; and (9) development
of analytical methods for monitoring hazardous chemicals in the environment, and determining of how those
agents chemically change over time. In the previous period of support, 29% of the PhD students supported
were from underrepresented groups, and 59% were female. Regarding postdocs, 18.2% were from
underrepresented groups, and 55% of the cohort was female. More than 600 students apply for the pre-
doctoral program annually, allowing for good program selectivity.
Highlights of the program are a well-structured and constantly updated academic toxicology Certificate
Program taken by PhD students, a pre- and post-doctoral mentoring program, numerous toxicology-focused
seminar programs and a large emphasis on research collaboration. We created a course entitled
Fundamentals of Toxicology and Environmental Health to cross-train our diverse group of engineers and

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a long-documented and continuing shortage of well-trained MD and PhD investigators in Gastroenterology & Hepatology. This issue was further highlighted as an urgent national need in the NIH authorized National Commission on Digestive Diseases Report (March 2009). The overall goal of this program is to provide a diverse group of post-doctoral trainees with an exceptional supervised training and mentoring experience in order to allow them to develop or enhance their research skills and knowledge in preparation for a successful gastroenterology- and hepatology-related research career. This program is intended for post- doctoral MD or PhD trainees and will provide support for 2 or 3 years (currently 2 fellows per year). Success in academic medicine requires not only developing one's own research program but also developing collaborations. Collaborations stimulate ideas, facilitate translational application and provide stimulus for program projects. We have identified research areas involving multiple investigators. Fellows interested in these topics are asked to meet with mentors from these topics. In turn, we encourage collaborative interactions between the various investigative groups that have common research themes. The salient point is that there are many exceptional opportunities for education of trainees in pivotal areas of gastrointestinal/hepatic research, and there is direct access to investigators with complementary skills potentially beyond the realm of the primary mentor; clearly, some of the accomplished faculty members fall into more than one theme category. The faculty of the T32 can be grouped into main 6 research groups: Mucosal Inflammation Program; Immunology of the Liver; Nutrition, Metabolic Syndrome, and Gut Microbiota; Gastroenterology and Hepatology Health Outcomes Policy and Economics Center; Gastrointestinal and Hepatic Cell and Molecular Biology; Carcinogenesis. In addition to the in-person evaluations of the trainee by the mentor and mentorship committee, the Research and Career Development Committee meets quarterly to review all of the trainees based on their personal interaction and the evaluations provided by the mentor and mentorship committees. As mentioned, this Committee not only evaluates the progress of the Trainees, but also of the program in general. The group discusses both how the trainee is doing in terms of their research project, their interaction with their primary mentor, their productivity in writing, their ability to write grants, their short-term and long-term goals,and whether they are on-track to becoming an independent investigator.",Gastrointestinal Diseases Training Grant,"PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE

in the US. To accomplish these goals, the Program is built on a unique medical school curriculum that
integrates medical education with original scholarly investigation. The defining feature of the Duke curriculum is
that all medical students engage in significant scholarly activity in the third year. As a consequence, the core
medical education takes place over three years, rather than four, with the preclinical basic sciences condensed
into the first year and core clinical clerkships taught in the second year. This curriculum is therefore ideally
suited to MSTP trainees, as it provides comprehensive clinical training prior to PhD training, allowing students
to align their research interests with their long-term clinical interests as well as shortening the time to the dual
degree. Over the past 5 years, the Duke MSTP has undergone a number of major changes and improvements
after it came under new directorship in 2006: 1) The admissions process was revamped to ensure recruitment
of top tier applicants while also addressing the problem of unacceptably high attrition rates; 2) Program
administration has been modified to ensure adequate oversight of the director and to provide enhanced input
from a broader range of outstanding faculty; 3) Improved trainee oversight has been incorporated at multiple
stages of the program; 4) Numerous program activities have been added to ensure adequate program-wide
training opportunities and to foster program unity; 5) An accelerated rotation structure has been added to allow
time for trainees to take Step 1 of the USMLE and to transition to their thesis labs by the middle of first-year of
graduate school; 6) Activities to ensure that clinical skills are not lost during the PhD years have been added;
7) Institutional support has improved dramatically; and 8) Multiple opportunities for trainees to influence their
own career development have been incorporated. These new program initiatives have built on the Duke
MSTP's tradition of excellent MD-PhD training to substantially improve and revitalize the program, preparing it
for growth over the next 5 years to a new steady state of approximately 88 students.",Medical Scientist Training Program,"8. PROJECT NARRATIVE

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for renewal of The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Medical Scientist Training Program, which is now in its 39th year. The Program seeks to train MD-PhD students for positions of leadership in academic medicine and medical research. Since our last submission in 2009, completed AMCAS applications have remained high, averaging 436 per year. Interviews are extended to approximately 15% of those applicants who complete both the AMCAS and Hopkins Secondary applications. Applicants invited for interviews have outstanding academic records (mean GPA 3.92), excellent MCAT scores (average total 38), significant laboratory research experience, and high motivation for careers in biomedical research and clinical medicine. Approximately 10-12 students enter the Program each year and on average 10 students receive MSTP awards. The average length of study for the combined degrees is 8 years (which is also the national average). There are currently 116 MD-PhD students in the Program; 96 have MSTP awards. Currently, 21.3% of the 116 students enrolled in the Hopkins Program are underrepresented in medicine. Students generally take two years of preclinical science courses in medical school and then enroll in one of 30 available graduate programs for approximately four years. Students in the Hopkins Program have a pool of over 1000 Hopkins faculty from which to select a potential mentor. During this time, students take advanced courses and complete thesis research, publishing an average of 6.1 peer-reviewed papers, before returning to the final required clinical clerkships and electives in medical school. In 2013, Andrea Cox, M.D., Ph.D. was appointed as Co- Director of the Hopkins MSTP. She is an Associate Professor of Medicine and Oncology, an active research scientist, and a board certified and practicing infectious disease specialist. Therefore, Dr. Cox brings to the MD-PhD leadership team a perspective on clinical medicine as well as basic research. From this point forward, Drs. Cox and Siliciano will co-direct the MD-PhD Program. Dr. Robert Siliciano, has been Director of the Program since 1999 and will continue co-directing the Program with Dr. Cox. The Co-Directors head a 26-member MD-PhD Committee that admits applicants and formulates policies for the Program. The committee members also assist the Co-Directors in advising trainees and evaluating student progress. The Program has been highly successful in fulfilling the goals initially set fort by the NIH. Since the inception of the Hopkins MSTP grant (1980-first graduates), 350 MD-PhD students have graduated from the Program. Of the 270 graduates who have completed postgraduate training and begun their careers, 83% are in medical research positions. This includes those in academic medicine (67%), those at research institutes such as the NIH (6%) and those in the pharmaceutical or biotech industries (10%).",Medical Scientist Training Program,"PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: MSTP Project Narrative Progress towards solving major health problems will require a steady source of well-trained new investigators who have the clinical background to appreciate major medical issues and the research skills to tackle them.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Continued support is requested for five years for five predoctoral trainees per year for an interdepartmental training program focused on the molecular genetics of basic cell functions. The emphasis is on rigorous training using the power of molecular genetics to study basic cell processes, such as chromosome replication, recombination, and segregation; evolution of genes and genomes; genome organization; gene function; regulation of transcription and translation; RNA processing; cell-to-cell communication; signal recognition and transduction; and membrane fusion. This training program has strongly benefited from continuous support from NIGMS since 1975. Students are supported in their second, third, or fourth year based on their commitment to in-depth genetics training in the context of thesis research. The training faculty, from the Departments of Molecular Biology & Microbiology, Developmental, Molecular & Chemical Biology, Integrative Physiology & Pathobiology, Medicine, and Chemistry, is highly interactive and dedicated to close, joint supervision and mentoring of graduate students. Importantly, the mentoring faculty has increased dramatically in the last three years because of recruitment of outstanding young faculty members and more senior investigators from a variety of disciplines that have genetics at the core of their research. Our training program, based in the Graduate Program in Molecular Microbiology, has a pool of 80-100 applicants and annually enrolls 5-7 new students, nearly all of whom are eligible for training grant support. The program has been successful in attracting a significant number of students from underrepresented groups (including six of the 33 students enrolled during the 2014-2015 academic year); all have been supported by this training grant. The majority of past trainees have obtained high-quality postdoctoral appointments and those who have completed this training are active members of the biomedical workforce with the majority pursuing careers as researchers in academia or industry. Others are high school science teachers, biotechnology-focused patent attorneys, or pursuing other science-related professions. Supported students take required courses that provide a strong grounding in genetics and are selected based on the relevance of their research to fundamental questions in molecular genetics. In addition to strong didactic training in genetics, all students are required o complete courses focused on scientific ethics and participate in teaching of medical or dental students and many have opportunities to mentor undergraduates in research activities.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application for T32GM007308-39, which funds the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at NYU School of Medicine (NYUSOM). The purpose of the MSTP is to train physician-scientists who will be capable of moving seamlessly between the realms of rigorous scientific inquiry and the holistic approach required for patient care. Students who successfully complete the MSTP graduate with both an MD and PhD degree. The MSTP at NYUSOM was one of the first three programs to be funded by NIGMS in 1964 and has been NIH funded ever since. Many of the 314 graduates have had illustrious careers and are counted among the leaders of academic medicine in the United States. The training begins with a summer research rotation, followed by three semesters of pre-clinical medical education punctuated by a second summer research rotation. Students then select a thesis lab and begin graduate work under the auspices of the Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Graduate training is offered in thirteen interdisciplinary training programs that include Biomedical Imaging, Biomedical Informatics, Cellular & Molecular Biology, Computational Biology, Developmental Genetics, Immunology and Inflammation, Microbiology, Molecular Biophysics, Molecular Oncology & Tumor Immunology, Molecular Pharmacology, Neuroscience & Physiology, Pathobiology, and Stem Cell Biology. Upon completion of a PhD thesis, the trainees return to medical school for the clinical portion of the curriculum, participating in all required clerkships as well as clinical electives. Trainees ar expected to complete the training in eight years or less. Over the past 5-year grant cycle, the median time-to-degree was 8.1 years. Mark Philips, MD, who runs an active molecular cell biology laboratory and who has trained 10 MSTP students, serves as the eighth director of the NYU MSTP and is assisted by two Co-Directors, Mitchell Chesler and Jennifer Philips, both MD/PhDs. A Faculty Operating Committee (FOC) and a full-time administrative staff assist the Co-directors. The training faculty consists of 121 full-time, tenure-track faculty who are selected
by the Co-directors for the quality of their research programs and their skills as mentors. Admission to the NYU MSTP is highly competitive. Over the past 5-year grant cycle 1883 students applied, 517 were interviewed, 197 (10.5%) were offered admission, and 47 matriculated. Significant effort is made to enhance the diversity of MSTP students. Of the 71 students currently enrolled in the MSTP, 10 (14%) are members of underrepresented minorities, one is disabled, and three are economically disadvantaged. The competitiveness of the NYU MSTP with regard to recruiting top candidates has improved over the past 5-year grant cycle both as a consequence of reorganization of the MSTP and the sharp rise of NYUSOM in the national rankings of research medical schools (37th to 19th). The Administration of NYUSOM supports the MSTP with substantial funding: in 2013 the Administration contributed $3,967,369 (57% of the total cost). At the last competing renewal, T32GM007308-34 received an outstanding priority score and 29 training slots were funded. The government sequester in 2012 reduced the funding to 25 slots. In accord with the recent academic success of the MSTP and of NYUSOM in general, we seek to expand the MSTP from 8-10 students per year to 10-12 and therefore request funding for 35 trainees.",Medical Scientist Research Service Award,"PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to renew funding for the NYU Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), one of 44 such programs funded by the National Institutes of Health.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Curriculum in Genetics and Molecular Biology (the Genetics Curriculum) is a well-established and highly-ranked interdepartmental PhD program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH). Throughout the 50-year life of the program we have provided diverse and cutting-edge research opportunities to trainees. In addition to our ongoing expertise in key areas in genetics (e.g., genetics of model microbes, plants, and animals) and molecular biology (e.g., signal transduction, gene expression, and virology), we have added strengths in epigenetics, clinical and translational genetics, systems genetics, quantitative genetics, computational genetics, and genomics. Extensive interaction between researchers in diverse areas is promoted by the interdepartmental and inter-school nature of the Genetics Curriculum and many faculty centers, and is facilitated by the physical proximity of the different units, all of which are on the same campus.  We strive to maintain a modern and innovative training program. The curriculum includes features common in similar programs, like coursework, written and oral qualifying exams, seminars, and retreats. Several years ago we introduced an innovative feature wherein selection of student and postdoctoral speakers for the annual Genetics Scientific Retreat are made by a mock study section at which training grant-appointed students score and discuss submitted abstracts. We've also innovated in coursework by transitioning to focused, modular courses that meet for a third of a semester and can be taken a la carte. This gives students greater flexibility choosing the most appropriate topics of study and allows faculty to teach withi their areas of greatest expertise. We now partner with the Department of Biology to expand teaching assistantship opportunities to include undergraduate courses at the introductory and advanced levels. The Office of Graduate Education has developed unique programs that enhance the training experience and promote career development.  We compete nationally for the top students and have successfully recruited a diverse group, with about 25% belonging to one of the NIH-defined diversity groups. Our students are successful in obtain competitive external funding, and every student publishes at least one first-authored research paper in a peer-reviewed journal (the mean is almost 4 publications).

Medical training is provided by the School of Medicine and research training is carried out in the interdisciplinary graduate programs of the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, and in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Anthropology. Together, these graduate programs encompass nearly all contemporary areas of biomedical research. The basic components of the MSTP are: 1) Two years of the preclinical medical school curriculum; 2) Coursework in a biomedically relevant discipline; 3) Three or more years of original, hypothesis-driven research leading to completion of a doctoral thesis; 4) At least 15 months of clinical training; and 5) A wealth of academic and social programs designed to enhance the program and cohesiveness of the student body. The M.D. and Ph.D. degrees are awarded jointly at the successful completion of both components which typically takes 7-8 years, a period shortened by integrating both curricula. Upon completion of subsequent postgraduate training, MSTP alumni will be prepared to enter the workforce as physician-scientists. Based on the track record of this program, the vast majority will join the faculty of te nation's medical schools while others will contribute to the nation's biomedical research enterprise in government laboratories, biotechnology firms, and the pharmaceutical industry. Regardless of their position, their MSTP training will allow them to bridge the gap between the basic laboratory and the clinic. The success of this program is due to strong institutional support

These goals are achieved through general and specialized courses, literature survey courses, laboratory rotations, a qualifying examination, thesis research with oversight from an advising committee, training in bioethics, and training grant-specific activities. Trainee-specific activities include an annual oral presentation of ongoing thesis research; attending the annual Cell and Molecular Biology Retreat; attending the Annual Trainee Organized Invited Lectures; participating in Alumni Day in which a former Trainee who has completed their Ph.D. and left Penn is invited back to give a seminar and meet with the Trainees; group attendance of Trainees/Trainer at the annual meeting of the American Society for Cell Biology meeting and the Current and Former Trainee Lunch in which 2 former Trainees present a talk on their thesis research. Students completing their second year of graduate studies are appointed for two years and are selected annually by the Executive Committee. Trainers come from the Schools of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Arts and Science, and Engineering and Applied Science, and the Wistar Institute and not only have active research programs in cell and molecular biology but also a commitment to graduate education. The training program has formal mechanisms to monitor trainees both during and after their training grant support. In addition, the training program has formal mechanisms to monitor trainers, as well as to resolve any conflicts between trainees and trainers. Last, Trainers
participate in a number of efforts to recruit under-represented minorities both locally and nationally. Direct management of the Training Program is done by an Executive Committee that sets and reviews policy and selects trainees.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application to support the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at Washington University in St. Louis. The overarching goal of the MSTP is to provide in-depth pre-doctoral training in clinical medicine and biomedical research for individuals desiring careers as physician-scientists. The applicant pool is strong and in the past funding period, the MSTP made significant strides in recruiting diversity students. Medical training is provided by the School of Medicine and research training is carried out in the interdisciplinary graduate programs of the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, and in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Anthropology. Together, these graduate programs encompass nearly all contemporary areas of biomedical research. The basic components of the MSTP are: 1) Two years of the preclinical medical school curriculum; 2) Coursework in a biomedically relevant discipline; 3) Three or more years of original, hypothesis-driven research leading to completion of a doctoral thesis; 4) At least 15 months of clinical training; and 5) A wealth of academic and social programs designed to enhance the program and cohesiveness of the student body. The M.D. and Ph.D. degrees are awarded jointly at the successful completion of both components which typically takes 7-8 years, a period shortened by integrating both curricula. Upon completion of subsequent postgraduate training, MSTP alumni will be prepared to enter the workforce as physician-scientists. Based on the track record of this program, the vast majority will join the faculty of te nation's medical schools while others will contribute to the nation's biomedical research enterprise in government laboratories, biotechnology firms, and the pharmaceutical industry. Regardless of their position, their MSTP training will allow them to bridge the gap between the basic laboratory and the clinic. The success of this program is due to strong institutional support

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application for T32GM007308-39, which funds the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at NYU School of Medicine (NYUSOM). The purpose of the MSTP is to train physician-scientists who will be capable of moving seamlessly between the realms of rigorous scientific inquiry and the holistic approach required for patient care. Students who successfully complete the MSTP graduate with both an MD and PhD degree. The MSTP at NYUSOM was one of the first three programs to be funded by NIGMS in 1964 and has been NIH funded ever since. Many of the 314 graduates have had illustrious careers and are counted among the leaders of academic medicine in the United States. The training begins with a summer research rotation, followed by three semesters of pre-clinical medical education punctuated by a second summer research rotation. Students then select a thesis lab and begin graduate work under the auspices of the Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences. Graduate training is offered in thirteen interdisciplinary training programs that include Biomedical Imaging, Biomedical Informatics, Cellular & Molecular Biology, Computational Biology, Developmental Genetics, Immunology and Inflammation, Microbiology, Molecular Biophysics, Molecular Oncology & Tumor Immunology, Molecular Pharmacology, Neuroscience & Physiology, Pathobiology, and Stem Cell Biology. Upon completion of a PhD thesis, the trainees return to medical school for the clinical portion of the curriculum, participating in all required clerkships as well as clinical electives. Trainees ar expected to complete the training in eight years or less. Over the past 5-year grant cycle, the median time-to-degree was 8.1 years. Mark Philips, MD, who runs an active molecular cell biology laboratory and who has trained 10 MSTP students, serves as the eighth director of the NYU MSTP and is assisted by two Co-Directors, Mitchell Chesler and Jennifer Philips, both MD/PhDs. A Faculty Operating Committee (FOC) and a full-time administrative staff assist the Co-directors. The training faculty consists of 121 full-time, tenure-track faculty who are selected
by the Co-directors for the quality of their research programs and their skills as mentors. Admission to the NYU MSTP is highly competitive. Over the past 5-year grant cycle 1883 students applied, 517 were interviewed, 197 (10.5%) were offered admission, and 47 matriculated. Significant effort is made to enhance the diversity of MSTP students. Of the 71 students currently enrolled in the MSTP, 10 (14%) are members of underrepresented minorities, one is disabled, and three are economically disadvantaged. The competitiveness of the NYU MSTP with regard to recruiting top candidates has improved over the past 5-year grant cycle both as a consequence of reorganization of the MSTP and the sharp rise of NYUSOM in the national rankings of research medical schools (37th to 19th). The Administration of NYUSOM supports the MSTP with substantial funding: in 2013 the Administration contributed $3,967,369 (57% of the total cost). At the last competing renewal, T32GM007308-34 received an outstanding priority score and 29 training slots were funded. The government sequester in 2012 reduced the funding to 25 slots. In accord with the recent academic success of the MSTP and of NYUSOM in general, we seek to expand the MSTP from 8-10 students per year to 10-12 and therefore request funding for 35 trainees.",Medical Scientist Research Service Award,"PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal seeks to renew funding for the NYU Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), one of 44 such programs funded by the National Institutes of Health.

A major goal of the program is to provide physician-scientists with the research expertise required to pursue clinical, basic and translational research careers in an academic setting. Physician trainees entering the program will have M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degrees and at least 2-3 years of clinical training in internal medicine or pediatrics. Ph.D. scientists are also recruited into the program since we believe an integrated training experience bringing together adult endocrinologists,  pediatric endocrinologists and endocrine scientists is necessary to prepare our trainees to participate in  modern multidisciplinary research groups. Trainees are selected based on their aptitude and commitment to a  research career. The duration of the training period is three years to ensure an in-depth training experience.  The cornerstone of the curriculum is the participation of each trainee in a specific research project under the supervision of a designated preceptor and guided by a progress committee composed of 2-3 other members of  the training faculty. Potential projects run the gamut from clinical to basic research in 3 primary areas of emphasis: 1) type 1 diabetes, 2) type 2 diabetes, and 3) bone and mineral metabolism.

The program spans four separate administrative units on the Berkeley campus: the Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology (MCB), Plant & Molecular Biology (PMB), Integrative Biology (IB), and the School of Public Health (PH). The program includes 43 training faculty, all prominent researchers in their respective areas of study (10 are members of the National Academy of Sciences). Training faculty represent three major areas of genetics research: developmental genetics, cell & systems-level analysis, and population genetics & evolution. Funds are requested to support the research activities of 15 graduate student trainees (per year) in genetics-oriented laboratories located within the four aforementioned administrative units. Trainees will be appointed by a steering committee composed of prominent faculty from each of the participating administrative units. This committee is also responsible for renewing the appointments of training faculty and appointing new faculty to the training program. In addition, the committee will review the efficacy of the training program by soliciting comments from past and present trainees and faculty. A number of mechanisms have been established to ensure that the proposed genetics training program offers a unique educational experience that is distinct from other programs on the Berkeley campus, such as genomics, cell & molecular biology, and immunology. First, genetics trainees are required to present their current research findings at an annual retreat that is restricted to trainees and their mentors. Second, all trainees will be required to enroll in at least one advanced genetics course, such as MCB 240. Third, all trainees are required to attend the annual Genetics, Genomics, and Development (GGD) retreat regardless of their departmental affiliations. And fourth, all trainees must participate in at least one additional genetics-oriented forum, such as the weekly GGD seminar series or regularly scheduled journal clubs and research meetings focused on topics in genetic analysis. A variety of outreach strategies will be employed to ensure that members of under- represented minorities, women, and disabled or otherwise disadvantaged students are given the opportunity to obtain training in this program and thereby gain access to the wonderful world of genetics.",Postgraduate Training Program in Genetics,"Our genes shape who we are.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competitive renewal of the nephrology training grant at Boston University. This vibrant and successful program has been active continuously for 41 years. Its primary goals are to identify, inspire and train promising postdoctoral candidates for translational research careers focused on kidney diseases and to assist qualified trainees in obtaining suitable research positions. The program is designed to provide physicians heading for careers in academic nephrology the thorough scientific grounding necessary for a successful research career and to attract recent PhD graduates and provide them postdoctoral training in kidney-related research. Training is closely aligned with the NCATS Advisory Council Working Group recommendations to prepare the next generation of biomedical scientists for translational research careers. Research training will continue for at
least two years. On average, three new trainees will enter the program each year. The principal mechanism for training is direct performance of research under the personal supervision of one or more of the training staff comprised of nine nephrologists and five basic scientists. Outstanding, interdisciplinary training staff provides translational training in autoimmunity, ischemic and toxic renal injury, immunopathology, gene regulation related to renal cancer and developmental biology, and vascular disease and thrombosis in chronic kidney disease and clinical epidemiology of cardiovascular relevant to kidney diseases. Well-established collaborative arrangements allow each trainee to acquire a broad research experience and focus a variety of skills on a specific research protocol. Trainees assume graded responsibility for the design, conduct and interpretation of experiments, progressively becoming more independent. All trainees and staff meet frequently for a rich menu of seminars, journal clubs and other formal group teaching exercises. Coursework leading to a PhD in Translational and Molecular Medicine is available, and formal training in clinical research is provided through the BU School of Public Health. Trainees work in a modern, well-equipped laboratory in the Evans Biomedical Research Center and laboratories of basic science faculty. These are in close proximity to core facilities, modern animal care quarters supervised by a full-time veterinarian, and the BUSPH. Collaboration and team building are emphasized throughout the training period. In this renewal we have taken advantage of substantial progress on the BU medical campus in bioinformatics, career development, evaluation, networking and tracking programs to enhance the training experience beyond the laboratory bench or research database. An Office of Postdoctoral Affairs supported by the Provost's office, and programs in Development and Diversity and Interdisciplinary Research add to the richness of the training environment and help promote a healthy work/life balance.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
This competitive renewal application represents the merger of two successful diabetes research training programs at Washington University, DK007120 (based in the Department of Medicine) and KD007296 (based in the Department of Pathology & Immunology), into a single program entitled Diabetes and Related Metabolic Diseases (DK007120). For more than 35 years, these two T32 programs have trained a large number of biomedical scientists who have generated important insights into diabetes. To continue training outstanding scientists and physicians capable of developing novel approaches to address the striking increase in diabetes and its complications, we have integrated these two longstanding programs into one. The goal of this merged program is to provide mentoring expertise spanning model systems to outcomes research within a nurturing, structured environment that will produce independent diabetes scientists likely to change the landscape of research in diabetes and its complications. The program is directed by two PIs with complementary skill sets, one in immunology, the other in metabolism, to facilitate training opportunities in the emerging field of immunometabolism. The merged program represents the only NIH-supported mechanism for postdoctoral training in diabetes research at Washington University.   The program is continually evolving in response to our ongoing assessment of its effectiveness, the needs of our trainees, and the dynamic nature of diabetes research. It is multidisciplinary and team-oriented. We propose to continue to train MD, MD PhD, and PhD scientists for 2-3 years through a structured program that leverages numerous strengths that include but are not limited to:  • An exceptional pool of 29 mentors focused on diabetes. These scientists are pursuing research in basic mechanisms, proof of principle T1 translation, T2/T3 translation to patients and practice, and T3/T4 translatio to practice and populations. This group includes two members of the National Academy of Sciences and one member of the Institute of Medicine, each having mentored trainees during this most recent funding period, and several new members representing a broad spectrum of career stage and diversity.  • A core curriculum in diabetes science required of all trainees to ensure that individuals with different backgrounds establish a standard knowledge base. • Training with a clinical context for PhD scientists as well as those with clinical degrees in order
to inform translational efforts.  • Clearly defined metrics of success that are monitored by a personalized Career Development Committee for each trainee. • A series of mechanisms to assess quality and effectiveness of the program as well as established procedures to take action in response to the results of these assessment tools. • A dynamically integrated short-term research training program operated in close collaboration with our NIDDK Diabetes Research Center. • Well-established mechanisms for enhancing diversity.     Our trainees are productive, having published more than 250 papers that have been cited more than 8000 times in the past 10 years. They are successful in terms of obtaining grant support for their research that includes (in the past 10 years) two R01s, several R01 equivalents (in the EU), three K01s, two K12s, two KL2s, one K99/R00, several pilot and feasibility awards, awards from the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association, and others. They are successful in terms of achieving productive scientific careers since our trainees enter academics (in the past 10 years) at a rate ~50-100% greater (depending on degree) than the biomedical workforce based on data cited by NIH. Our integration of two programs has achieved synergies leading to improvements in the mentor pool, enhancements in recruitment and mentoring strategies, and expanded efforts to increase diversity that collectively perpetuate a culture of multidisciplinary training with a very high likelihood of exerting a sustained and powerful influence on diabetes research.     
",Diabetes and Related Metabolic Diseases,"PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diabetes in the United States is increasing in prevalence at an alarming rate. This increase affects all ages and all ethnic groups, and in children and adolescents both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are increasing. Certain overwhelming complications of the disease, in particular stroke, amputations, and end stage renal disease are also increasing. The burden of diabetes is emotionally as well as economically devastating, and current therapies are less than ideal. This application is relevant to public health since its goalis to rigorously train scientists in a broad spectrum of approaches to diabetes and its complications in order to translate new observations into new therapies with the potential of decreasing the burden of diabetes.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The enclosed proposal represents a competitive renewal of an established graduate training program in Genetics at UC Berkeley. We request funds to support 17 graduate trainees in the areas of Developmental Genetics and Genomics, Cell & Systems Genetics, and Population Genetics and Evolution. Students enter this inter-disciplinary training program after gaining admission into one of four Departments on campus. Two of the Departments, Molecular and Cell Biology (MCB) and Integrative Biology (IB), are located within the College of Letters and Sciences. A third Department, Plant and Microbial Biology (PMB), is located in the College of Natural Resources. Students can also enter the training program through the School of Public Health (SPH). Students are selected into the program based on an interest in one of the broadly defined areas of genetics that are sponsored by this training grant. They are also selected based on merit and future promise as independent investigators. Despite their diverse backgrounds, the training program includes a number of mechanisms to ensure that all of the graduate students obtain rigorous training in genetics. Once they enter the program, students are free to select any one of 41 different faculty mentors located in the four aforementioned performance sites. These faculty employ a variety of genetic and genomic methods to study a broad spectrum of problems in cell, developmental, and evolutionary biology, including metazoan and plant patterning, embryogenesis, sex determination, cell determination and differentiation, morphogenesis, and organogenesis. The study of cellular processes in the areas of signal transduction, DNA replication, transcription, cell trafficking and the cytoskeleton, transcription, and DNA replication are the focus of many faculty. Other faculty use genetic approaches to study evolutionary processes such as the evolution of chordates and patterning in invertebrates. In the first year of the program, trainees complete advanced lecture, laboratory, and seminar courses. Students in PMB and MCB are also required to complete three 10-week laboratory rotations with potential dissertation mentors. All students commence their dissertation research by the beginning of the second year. They are also required to complete an oral qualifying exam that is administered by four faculty from at least two different departments within the training program. All students are required to complete at least two semesters of teaching as graduate instructors during the second and third years of the training program. In addition to formal course offerings in the different areas of genetics, students are expected to participate in a variety of seminar programs, joint lab meetings, journal clubs, and retreats that are sponsored by the Genetics Training Program.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal seeks renewal for UCLA's predoctoral Cellular and Molecular Biology Training Program. Now in its 30th year, the program has trained 414 Ph.D. candidates for careers in biomedical research and education. These students have gone on to make discoveries that have improved human health and we expect that future trainees will also follow in their footsteps with the training received here. The program is interdepartmental and includes faculty and students in both the UCLA College and the School of Medicine, including the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry; Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology; Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics; Biological Chemistry; and Neurobiology, as well as, the Interdepartmental Program in Molecular Biology. There are currently 40 training faculty with primary appointments in nine departments, including those listed above and Pathology and Laboratory Medicine; Physiological Sciences; Medicine; and Urology. Major research areas include biochemistry, cell biology, developmental biology, gene expression, macromolecular structure, molecular and cellular immunology, neurobiology, virology and microbial pathology.  
  
Trainees are self-nominated from each of the six major Ph.D. programs involved. Students are selected on a highly competitive basis using the criteria of their academic and research achievements. Appointments are made for a maximum period of three years. A small number of students enter the Training Program as first year Ph.D. students; the majority, however, come in after a year of graduate work when they have chosen their dissertation research director. In addition to meeting the University and Departmental or Program requirements for their degrees, trainees participate in a research ethics course, as well as in seminars and conferences organized by the Training Program. This proposal requests stipends for 45 trainees.  
  
The facilities are those of a major undergraduate and graduate campus of approximately 33,000 students that includes a medical school faculty. All of the departments involved in this program are in close proximity to each other and to the interdepartmental Molecular Biology Institute, which facilitates interactions of both students and faculty.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
The postdoctoral research training program in Endocrinology and Diabetes at the Massachusetts General Hospital is intended to provide intensive research experience in basic or clinical investigation, complemented by didactic research training in basic sciences pertinent to endocrinology and diabetes. The trainees are primarily M.D.'s and M.D./Ph.D.'s who desire a career in investigative endocrinology and academic medicine, as well as Ph.D.'s who want further research training. The trainees are selected from a large applicant pool on the basis of prior academic and/or research achievement, and evidence of strong commitment to a career in biomedical investigation. The Program director (J. Avruch) is a senior academician/endocrine investigator who governs in conjunction with a committee of experienced endocrine scientists (Habener, Kronenberg, Crowley, Neer, Freeman and Klibanski). The training faculty consists of 46 active, well-funded scientists, whose interests range broadly across the subdisciplines of endocrinology, and from clinical investigation to the regulation of gene expression, protein structural analysis, transmembrane signaling mechanisms, etc. The trainees are supervised closely by a primary faculty mentor, and interact extensively with junior faculty, who often serve as secondary mentors. A carefully evolved and extensive program of didactic sessions complements the research activity. The training period is 2-3 years but may include several years additional experience at junior faculty status, so as to permit consolidation of skills and maximal competitiveness for independent support. The productivity of past trainees during training has been very high overall, as judged by the number and quality of trainee publications. Among the program graduates since 1990 supported by this grant, the majority remain in academia and a substantial number are in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry. Among those in academia, about one quarter have achieved independent support equivalent to an RO-1 and nearly one third have achieved transitional independent support, a usual precursor to RO-1 support. The facilities at the MGH are extensive, including an active GCRC, an Institutional Clinical Research Support Program, access to a very large base of endocrine/diabetes patients, and over 40,000 square feet of fully equipped modern laboratory dedicated to our training faculty. The institutional training grant represents the central stabilizing financial element in this program, and is especially critical in enabling M.D. trainees to achieve careers in biomedical investigation

Students obtain teaching experience through a requirement to serve as teaching assistants in undergraduate introductory genetics or evolutionary biology for at least one semester in their second or third year. During their first year, students participate in lecture courses in either a molecular or a population and evolutionary genetics track, and they complete 3-4 laboratory research rotations. They then begin dissertation research and in years 2-5 enroll in seminars, advanced electives and special topics courses. To ensure that students complete degree requirements in a timely manner, progress is monitored twice yearly by the Graduate Affairs Committee and students' dissertation committees. Written and oral examinations and major courses must be completed by the end of the fifth semester, and students meet at least once annually with their dissertation committees. A major strength of the program is the interdisciplinary training students receive in molecular, population and evolutionary genetics from 33 training faculty representing a wide range of genetic disciplines. Students in each curriculum track take at least one major course in the other track. In addition, attendance is expected at departmental seminars and symposia. Graduates from this training program over the past 33 years have been highly successful in careers in academia, government, and industry. The training program is dynamic and will continue to produce broadly trained leaders in genetics as it embraces the exciting genetic developments of the 21st Century.

The goal of this program is to train scientists in fields related to lung diseases. We propose to accomplish this by providing formal course work, doctoral and post-doctoral degree programs, and laboratory based training in six major disciplines related to lung biology: Pulmonary Vascular biology, Developmental Biology of the Airways and Lung Vasculature, Lung Matrix Biology, Immunology and Inflammation, Genetics and Epidemiology of Lung Diseases, and Bioinformatics/Systems Biology. In this 6th renewal (31st year) we have developed a new comprehensive program in Systems Biology, building on our existing strengths in genomics and bioinformatics to add proteomics and an integrated approach to lung cell biology. In that regard, we have expanded the formal degree granting curricula and added outstanding senior faculty in Bio-informatics, genomics and proteomics and vascular biology to complement our existing programs. These new faculty interact with all our core disciplines to provide an integrated approach to Systems Biology of each research program. Predoctoral students in the M.D./PhD. Medical School Program, Biochemistry, Pathology, Immunology (either Microbiology or Pathology) and Engineering (Bioinformatics/Systems Biology) Ph.D. graduate programs are offered support for directed study through course work and thesis mentorship with Pulmonary Training Grant faculty. Post-doctoral M.D. trainees accepted into our Clinical Pulmonary Fellowship who express interest in pursuing careers in science participate in three to four years of research post-doctoral fellowship in one of the disciplines noted. During that time, they may elect any of three formal training programs: an M.P.H. degree program in Lung epidemiology or genetics sponsored by the School of Public Health; enrollment in our CREST program in translational medicine or a new Masters in Bio-Informatics. This renewal also provides a pathway to capture Ph.D. post-doctoral fellows who seek training in lung related biology. This award has trained over 60 doctoral students in Biochemistry, Pathology, Immunology and Engineering and 130 post-doctoral fellows over the past 29 years in disciplines related to lung diseases. Our graduates include 8 current or former Academic Chiefs of Pulmonary Medicine, three Chairs in Medicine, numerous Professors of Medicine and national leaders in every field of Pulmonary Science.

In each of these tracks, exposure to the clinical aspects of the area selected (comprising less than 20 percent of the total trainee time during the tenure of this fellowship) will be provided to permit the trainee to understand the clinical context in which the research which he or she is to undertake is placed.  The reminder of the time (at least 80 percent) will be spend in a defined tutorial research program with a preceptor in one of the laboratories or clinical investigation areas described in this grant proposal.  The trainees in all tracks will also take part in inter- and intradepartmental seminars and conferences, and will be expected to report orally and in writing on the research being performed.  The trainee will be able to take whatever course work at Duke University is necessary for the satisfactory completion of his or her work.  Trainees in areas of clinical investigation will be encouraged to pursue either a masters in public health degree (at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) or a masters in health sciences in clinical research degree granted by the Duke University Clinical Research Training Program (formerly the Biometry Training Program); at a minimum, they will be expected to complete an introductory course in statistics.  The training program funded by this award will be offered to qualified persons holding either the M.D. or Ph.D. degree with interests in research training in transfusion medicine and related areas.  Persons from minority groups and women will be encouraged to enter the program.  No predoctoral or primarily clinical competence training will be funded by this grant.  The facilities for research training will be based at the various. research laboratories and clinics of Duke University and the allied Veterans' Administration Medical Centers in Durham., North Carolina.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is an application for renewal of a longstanding program for predoctoral training in Pharmacological Sciences. Eight training slots are requested to support students in their first two years. The program seeks to meet the need for well-trained scientists who can maintain rapid progress in applying advances in biology to medicine. Rigorous training in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, structural biology, and cell biology, as well as pharmacology, forms the foundation of the program. These many disciplines are reflected in the research activities and classes offered to the students. The training program is conducted under the aegis of the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) graduate program at Harvard Medical School. BBS draws its faculty members from various basic science departments and their affiliates, and the training program faculty is a subset of this group. The central department for this program is Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, although faculty members from other departments play important roles in the training program.  The various departments and the training grant faculty are highly interactive. The research activities of the training grant faculty span a broad spectrum of pharmacological sciences with multiple areas of research strength. Students in the program are closely advised and monitored. In their first year, they take core courses covering multiple disciplines in basic biomedical sciences including pharmacological sciences, and a course that stresses reading original research papers and critical thinking. They are then required to take an advanced pharmacology course. Other courses offered include advanced courses in pharmacological sciences and/or human biology, which also stress critical thinking and the primary literature. Full time thesis research follows course work, laboratory rotations, and qualifying examinations. Students receive training in teaching, and participate in multiple other training activities including a yearly Science Day, seminars, journal clubs, and data presentation. This training plan should ensure the strengthening of a program that aims to train students who can play leadership roles in pharmacological sciences.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Purpose: The Training Program in Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center is committed to preparing highly motivated post-doctoral candidates for investigative careers in gastrointestinal research. Building on a 29 year background of sustained scientific accomplishment, the program has embarked on an exciting period of new growth and expansion of training opportunities since this application was last reviewed. This growth is marked by the recruitment of new research faculty, the successful competition for new NIH (and other) grants, and the development of programs that utilize sophisticated molecular and biophysical technologies to address basic issues in gastrointestinal research. Further, the availability of-formal coursework has been expanded; clinical, translational and outcomes research opportunities have been increased and significant new research programs have been developed to enhance the breadth and quality of training. These intellectual and capital resources contribute to an outstanding environment for career development of two new trainees per year. We propose to extend the period of training from 2 to 3 years for each trainee to accommodate the coursework and research experience that is necessary for a committed trainee to be successful in an academic career.  
Resources: The nucleus of the program is provided by 32 distinguished faculty members (19 MD, 3 MD PhD, and 10PhD) with research interests centered around three major themes, including i) cell and molecular biology of gastrointestinal and liver tissues ii) nutrition and carcinogenesis and iii) clinical trials and outcomes in hepatitis, liver transplantation and gastrointestinal endoscopy. The expertise of the faculty ranges from fundamental basic science to clinical, translational, outcomes and behavioral investigation. The training faculty participate in 7 major center, 6 project, and 93 individual extramural grants. These resources allow trainees an opportunity to approach gastrointestinal diseases from clinical, behavioral, epidemiologic, physiologic, biochemical, molecular and genetic perspectives. Trainees may elect to earn a Certificate, Masters or PhD degree during their training.  
Program: With the advice of the leadership of the adult and pediatric Divisions of Gastroenterology, the Executive Committee provides the overall direction and strategic planning for the program. The faculty draws broadly from nationally recognized research and training programs in other Divisions and Departments to provide the best training opportunities possible. Each year, two trainees are recruited from fellowship and doctoral programs in both clinical and basic science disciplines. Selection is based upon a confirmed commitment to a research-oriented career, an integrated research training plan, and the support of appropriate faculty with established credentials in the field of interest to ensure optimal scientific and career mentoring. The long-term goal of this program is to identify and support new investigators committed to rigorous training in gastrointestinal research, and to continue to develop the scientific and academic leaders for the future.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
The postdoctoral research training program in Endocrinology and Diabetes at the Massachusetts General Hospital is intended to provide intensive research experience in basic or clinical investigation, complemented by didactic research training in basic sciences pertinent to endocrinology and diabetes. The trainees are primarily M.D.'s and M.D./Ph.D.'s who desire a career in investigative endocrinology and academic medicine, as well as Ph.D.'s who want further research training. The trainees are selected from a large applicant pool on the basis of prior academic and/or research achievement, and evidence of strong commitment to a career in biomedical investigation. The Program director (J. Avruch) is a senior academician/endocrine investigator who governs in conjunction with a committee of experienced endocrine scientists (Habener, Kronenberg, Crowley, Neer, Freeman and Klibanski). The training faculty consists of 46 active, well-funded scientists, whose interests range broadly across the subdisciplines of endocrinology, and from clinical investigation to the regulation of gene expression, protein structural analysis, transmembrane signaling mechanisms, etc. The trainees are supervised closely by a primary faculty mentor, and interact extensively with junior faculty, who often serve as secondary mentors. A carefully evolved and extensive program of didactic sessions complements the research activity. The training period is 2-3 years but may include several years additional experience at junior faculty status, so as to permit consolidation of skills and maximal competitiveness for independent support. The productivity of past trainees during training has been very high overall, as judged by the number and quality of trainee publications. Among the program graduates since 1990 supported by this grant, the majority remain in academia and a substantial number are in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry. Among those in academia, about one quarter have achieved independent support equivalent to an RO-1 and nearly one third have achieved transitional independent support, a usual precursor to RO-1 support. The facilities at the MGH are extensive, including an active GCRC, an Institutional Clinical Research Support Program, access to a very large base of endocrine/diabetes patients, and over 40,000 square feet of fully equipped modern laboratory dedicated to our training faculty. The institutional training grant represents the central stabilizing financial element in this program, and is especially critical in enabling M.D. trainees to achieve careers in biomedical investigation

In addition, it utilizes the faculty and facilities of other divisions within the University's immunology community, such the Graduate Program in Immunology, the Division of Rheumatology and the Division of Clinical Immunology in the Department of Medicine.  
The program provides 3 years of balanced training in basic and clinical immunology to Pediatricians who will pursue an academic career.  Candidates will have completed a 2-4 year residency in Pediatrics.  They will be selected primarily based upon their commitment to an academic career and their interest in research in the allergic and immunologic diseases of children. Each trainee spends the majority of his/her time in laboratory research (80%), supplemented with course work and limited clinical responsibilities.  A single faculty member acts as the preceptor for a given fellow, supervising his/her laboratory work, helping to select formal course work, and designing a program of clinical activities. The laboratory work focuses on one of the areas in which the faculty is actively involved and includes immunology and Epidemiology of Childhood Asthma (Drs. Eggleston, Wood, Matsui, Lederman, Bochner and Adkinson), the role of immune system in host defense and inflammation (Drs. Lederman, Bochner, Rosen, Sule and Desiderio) and the Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases, (Drs. Lederman, Winkelstein, Sule, Rosen and Desiderio).  Course work includes both a core curriculum designed to give the fellow a strong foundation in basic immunology and elective courses aimed at meeting the special needs of the fellow.  Clinical training focuses on Allergy and Immunology but also includes limited experience in Rheumatology, Pulmonology, and ENT, and is in accord with that specified by the Board of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.",Research Training in Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,,ROBERT A WOOD,6785863

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
The goals of this program are to identify, inspire and train promising candidates for research careers in academic nephrology and to assist qualified trainees in obtaining suitable academic positions. The program is designed to provide physicians heading for careers in academic nephrology the thorough scientific grounding necessary for a successful research career and to attract recent PhD graduates and provide them postdoctoral research training in a scientific discipline relevant to nephrology. Research training will continue for at least two years. On average, three new trainees will enter the program each year.  
The principal mechanism for training is direct performance of research under the personal supervision of one or more of the training staff comprised of nine nephrologists and seven basic scientists. Experienced, interdisciplinary training staff provide training in immunopathology, autoimmunity, renal cell physiology, ischemic and toxic renal injury, gene regulation related to renal cancer and developmental biology, and clinical research relevant to kidney diseases. Well-established collaborative arrangements allow each trainee to acquire a broad research experience and focus a variety of skills on a specific research protocol. Trainees assume graded responsibility for the design, conduct and interpretation of experiments, progressively becoming more independent but always remaining under the supervision of the preceptor. All trainees and staff meet frequently for seminars, journal clubs and other formal group teaching exercises. Coursework leading to a PhD is available in the Graduate Program in Molecular Medicine, and formal training in clinical research is provided through the BU School of Public Health and Division of Graduate Medical Sciences.  
Trainees work in modern, well-equipped laboratory space in the Evans Biomedical Research Center and laboratories of basic science faculty. These are in close proximity to core facilities, modern animal care quarters supervised by a full-time veterinarian, and the BUSPH. The General Clinical Research Center at Boston Medical Center is available for clinical studies

 continue to support the training of graduate students in Cell and Developmental    
 Biology at Harvard Medical School. Trainee support under this grant is             
 primarily for first and second year students, but under unusual circumstances      
 is used to support advanced students. These students are selected based on         
 their potential for cell and developmental biology research. The program           
 outlined in this proposal will support the graduate training of 23 Ph.D.           
 students (about 13% of the enrolled first and second year students). Research      
 activities in cell and developmental biology focuses on understanding the          
 properties that enable cells of higher organisms to grow tissues and organs and    
 the molecular processes that underlie the development of complex organisms. The    
 program in Cell and Developmental Biology of Harvard Medical School is one of      
 the major components of the Biological and Biomedical Sciences program (BBS).      
 This is a transdepartmental graduate program with 299 graduate students and 230    
 faculty. Our student pool has improved markedly in their preparation and           
 qualifications. Our faculty members are from the departments of Biological         
 Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Cell Biology, Genetics, Microbiology and     
 Molecular Genetics, and Pathology at Harvard Medical School. The research          
 activities of the program faculty on this training grant are concentrated in       
 the following areas: development in metazoans and differentiation of cells (16     
faculty), the cell cycle (14 faculty), cell death (3 faculty), signal              
 transduction in developing systems (29 faculty), trafficking, the cytoskeleton,    
 and cell asymmetry (15 faculty), proteolysis during the cell cycle and cell        
 morphogenesis (3 faculty). The training program utilizes a multi-disciplinary      
 approach based on class work, an extensive seminar and meeting program, and a      
 vigorous research environment to educate students. Students admitted to the        
 program have previous training in biology, biochemistry, molecular biology,        
 genetics, microbiology, cell biology, or chemistry. This graduate research         
 program leads to the awarding of a Doctorate of Philosophy. Students               
 participate in both required and elective courses in the first and second years    
 of training. Courses are selected in consultation with faculty preceptors who      
 advise and direct students until they have their own advisory committees.          
 Students in the program are required to take eight graduate courses and to         
 conduct three rotations in different laboratories. Before starting their thesis    
 work the students must acquire a strong background in biochemistry and cell        
 biology and they must pass a qualifying examination in which they write and        
 defend a research proposal.",CELLULAR AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY,,MARC Wallace KIRSCHNER,1863369

 however, the bulk of them come in after a year of graduate work when they have     
 chosen their dissertation research director. In addition to meeting the            
 University and Departmental or Program requirements for their degrees, trainees    
 participate in a research ethics course, as well as in seminars and conferences    
 organized by the Training Program. This proposal requests stipends for 45          
 trainees.                                                                          
                                                                                    
 The facilities are those of a major undergraduate and graduate campus of           
 approximately 33,000 students that includes a medical school faculty. All of       
 the departments involved in this program are in close proximity to each other      
 and to the interdepartmental Molecular Biology Institute, which facilitates        
 interactions of both students and faculty.

 College of Medicine with 14 active and 7 pending NEI grants apply for              
 continuation of a training program for visual sciences begun in 1975. The          
 objective of this program is to provide a laboratory-based research experience     
 to predoctoral students (4 per year) and postdoctoral fellows (2 per year) who     
 are interested in pursuing careers in vision research. Trainees will have          
 opportunities to do research in the broad disciplines of molecular biology,        
 biochemistry, developmental biology, structural and computational biology, cell    
 biology, neurophysiology, and psychophysics. The sixteen preceptors have           
 research interests covering almost the entire visual system (lens and cornea,      
 retina, LGN and cortex, and visual system development). The emphasis of this       
 training program is to create an interacting training environment so that          
 trainees can receive multi-disciplinary training and comprehensive knowledge of    
 the entire visual system. Predoctoral trainees are recruited to vision research    
 labs through seven Ph.D. graduate student programs (total enrollment of 243).      
 Each trainee participates in vigorous and comprehensive training programs          
 including formal courses, qualifying exams, lab rotations, seminars, journal       
 clubs and research. There are 323 postdoctoral trainees in the eight               
 participating departments of this Training Grant, and they participate in many     
 organized postdoctoral training activities including active inter-departmental     
 collaborations, seminars, vision research courses, grand rounds and journal        
 clubs. Dr Samuel Wu, who is assisted by three committees (the Steering             
 Committee, Recruitment/Ad mission Committee, and the Academic Progress             
 Committee) directs the Training Program. The 16 vision research labs occupy        
 over, 25,000 sq. ft. All 16 preceptors and. their trainees are members of an       
 NEI-funded Core grant (EY02520), which consists of three modules (Confocal and     
 Digital Imaging, Electron Microscopy and Histology, and Machine Shop) located      
 at the Cullen Eye Institute (about 2,900 sq. ft.) within 3 minutes walk from       
 all labs. Additionally, there are large core animal facilities (including          
 primate, mouse and xenopus facilities) available for vision researchers in this    
 Training Program. Our goal is to produce outstanding vision researchers to face    
 scientific and medical challenges in the 21st century.",RESEARCH TRAINING IN VISUAL SCIENCES,,Samuel M Wu,7354218

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
This Research Training Grant renewal application is an extensively revised resubmission of our initial proposal to support cross-disciplinary and comprehensive dental science research training at the School of Dentistry at the University of Washington. The application constitutes the competing renewal of the former Oral Biology-Salivary Research Training and the Bacterially Induced Chronic Inflammation Research Training grants. The revised application consists of a single research training facility and program, focused on using molecular and cell biology and bioengineering approaches to study the basic biology of the oral tissues and their reactions to microbial pathogens and inert materials. The Program is administered by a Program Coordinator, and directed by a Program Oversight Committee. The collaborating Training Faculty include individuals from the Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Public Health and the Department of Bioengineering; and are organized into 12 groups based on research interests. The proposed training program consists of two phases: 1) All trainees will receive coursework in the major competency areas cited in the PA including: genomics, molecular biology and molecular epidemiology, gene-mediated diagnosis and therapeutics, cell biology, bioinformatics, biomaterials, biomimetics, nanotechnology, tissue engineering and bioimaging technology. Coursework will also include experimental design and data analysis, and dental sciences. PhD students will receive the most training; MS and short-term trainees will receive less. 2) All trainees will learn to perform biological experiments using molecular and cell biology and/or bioengineering approaches by designing and performing experiments under the direction of a Research Mentor chosen from the proposed training faculty. A total of 12.75 training positions are requested, of which 6 are postdoctoral and 5 are predoctoral long term positions, 1.5 are short term positions for dental students, and 0.25 are short term positions for new and midcareer dental school faculty. Although long term trainees may elect to matriculate in a PhD or MS (dentists only) programs in 6 departments, Oral Biology and Bioengineering are expected to have highest enrollments. Courses to be taken in conjunction with this training are described in some detail.",Cross-Disciplinary Dental Science Research Training,,Kenneth T Izutsu,1877343

The application seeks maintenance of the current level of funding (5 stipends per year) to serve as the core source of support for postdoctoral research training in diabetes and endocrinology at the Yale School of Medicine. The request is based on our record of attracting a strong applicant pool for this program, the high level of research productivity of the training faculty, and the continuing shortage of physician-scientists in both adult and pediatric endocrinology/diabetes. A major goal of the program is to develop physician-scientists who possess the requisite laboratory skills to pursue and compete effectively in academic medicine. Physician trainees entering the program will have an M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degree and at least 2-3 years of clinical training in medicine or pediatrics. Ph.D. scientists are also recruited to the program since we believe their participation is critical to the training environment. Heavy emphasis in the selection process is given to those applications demonstrating potential and desiring research training for a career in clinical investigation. The duration of the training period is three years so as to provide a more in-depth training experience. The cornerstone of the curriculum involves the participation by the trainee in a specific laboratory project under the direction of a designated preceptor. The research projects offered span the gamut from clinical investigation to basic science and are designed to develop the laboratory skills required for a faculty appointment in internal medicine, pediatrics, or in a basic science department. The scope of the program has been expanded to provide the trainees with greater exposure to state-of-the-art laboratory techniques. Research opportunities are available in three major areas: 1) pathophysiology of diabetes, 2) immunology of diabetes, and 3) developmental and bone biology. Trainees have the opportunity to participate in ongoing projects involving collaborations with basic science departments in genetics, cell biology and immunobiology. Close interactions among preceptors within each programmatic area serve to further enrich the training experience. Instruction is also provided by means of an organized series of lectures, research seminars, and journal clubs. ",DIABETES MELLITUS AND DISORDERS OF METABOLISM,,ROBERT S SHERWIN,1882029

 DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): The present application is    
 for continued support for Research Training in Mental Health Epidemiology          
 (originally, Research Training in Psychosocial Epidemiology). The major goal of    
 the program is to provide rigorous training in the application of epidemiologic    
 methods to psychosocial and psychiatric research. Since its inception in 1975,     
 this program has had an unusual degree of stability in its core training           
 faculty and overall objectives. Students who have participated in this program     
 have demonstrated outstanding success in developing careers with important         
 contributions to psychiatric and psychosocial epidemiology. Dr. Stan Kasl has      
 been the Principal Investigator since 1975; however, Dr. Kathleen Merikangas       
 now will take over as Program Director and Dr. Kasl will become Co-Director.       
 The major components of the training include faculty mentoring, formal course      
 work in epidemiology, applied research experience, and clinical practica, where    
 relevant. The present application requests support for 4 pre-doctoral and 4        
 post-doctoral trainees. Trainees will be recruited to represent the following      
 focal areas: psychosocial epidemiology, psychiatric epidemiology, genetic          
 epidemiology, and biostatistics. The substantive areas of expertise in this        
 program include links between psychosocial risk factors, psychopathology and       
 chronic diseases, comorbidity of psychiatric disorders and substance abuse,        
 genetic epidemiology of behavioral and emotional disorders, and a new future       
 direction of prevention. Faculty interests cover all stages of the life span       
 ranging from childhood to late life. Strengths of this program include: (1) the    
 availability of an excellent formal academic program in the Department of          
 Epidemiology and Public Health including programs in Chronic Disease

The training grant is administered by the Environmental Toxicology Center which is directed by Dr. Colin R. Jefcoate. The training program is actively managed by Dr. Jefcoate, the Program Director, and the Training Grant Committee. The committee is made up of six members selected from the 19 trainers from the program to serve three-year terms on a rotation basis. The committee also represents the special interest of the training grant with the Environmental Toxicology Center with respect to important training issues. The standing committees in the Center are responsible for standardized admission and curriculum activities. The standing committees are: Admission Committee, Graduate Achievement and Curriculum Committee and Steering Committee. The training faculty of the program consists of 19 individuals from 10 departments. All but four of them are also members of the Environmental Toxicology Center. In addition, most of them are also members of the proposed NIEHS Center for Developmental and Molecular Toxicology. The trainees will be educated in a curriculum involving biochemistry, genetics and cell biology disciplines. In addition to identifying immunotoxicology and neurotoxicology as new areas of toxicology during the last grant application, developmental toxicology will be developed as a new educational component for the trainees in this application. The application requests funding for eight predoctoral and two postdoctoral positions for five years. After admission to the program, predoctoral students typically select a mentor during the first semester rotation through three laboratories. The selection is based mainly on matching the interest between the student and the faculty as well as the funding support of the faculty. After selection of a laboratory, trainees typically work alongside a senior graduate student or postdoctoral associate who is working on a related topic. A research advisory committee will then be set up for each student. Trainees meet with advisors regularly, at least once per week to discuss course work and research. The curriculum for the NIEHS predoctoral trainees is being revised. Each of the required core courses: Toxicology I and II, Ecotoxicology and Chemicals in the Environment, has been or being revised. Each course is being established in a modular format with three one-credit modules. This revision is supposed to provide more flexibility for Ph.D. students. For example, it is under review that the NIEHS predoctoral trainees may take all modules of the two courses in Toxicology but only four or six modules from the other two core courses. The trainees will also take advanced courses: a two credit advanced course on Molecular Approaches to Toxicant Metabolism and two one credit Advanced Workshop courses. A new advanced course in Developmental Toxicology is being developed and the trainees are expected to take this course also. The remaining requirements for the trainees are six credits of Biochemistry and one credit/semester of Toxicology seminar. After completion of the courses, trainees will take a rigorous three-part Preliminary Examination. Their progress in research will be supervised by the Research Advisory Committee. A special training experience for the NIEHS postdoctoral trainees is that they meet regularly with a group of trainers and must write a proposal early in the support period for external support. These trainees present their research on a regular basis at the Environmental Toxicology Center evening meetings and at least once in the regular program seminar series. In addition, they submit a brief annual report on their research progress which stresses the toxicological relevance of the research.

unchanged. The goal is to prepare carefully selected physicians of high         
investigative potential, who have completed their clinical training, for        
productive research careers. The centerpiece of this training effort is         
direct involvement by trainees in research, under the preceptorship of          
experienced scientists who have a record of productive, well-funded             
investigation and a demonstrated devotion to research training. Trainees        
participate actively in all phases of the investigative process:                
formulation of sound hypotheses, mastery of fundamental concepts and            
technics, background reading, didactic offerings, hands-on experience at        
the bench and discussions with preceptors and collaborating                     
investigators. Rigorous attention to experimental design, including             
biostatistical considerations, is emphasized, as are the writing of             
protocols; direct performance of the research; data analysis and                
interpretation; ethical considerations in research; and the preparation         
of verbal and written presentations and publications. Trainees                  
investigative activities are reviewed by the Preceptor, collaborating           
investigators, at Divisional Research Conferences, by visiting                  
consultants and, twice each year, by the Divisions Education Committee.         
The outcomes of trainees who have completed this Training Program have          
been, and continue to be, positive. The majority of our graduates have          
entered productive academic-investigative careers at institutions               
throughout the United States; and a number have achieved leadership             
positions in Pulmonary Medicine.

The members of our interdisciplinary team (10 M.D.'s and 6 Ph.D.'s) with expertise in ethanol metabolism, hepatology, gastroenterology, pharmacology, biochemistry, pathology, nutrition, immunology, anatomy, psychiatry and psychology, conduct studies on patients as well as experimental models of alcoholic injury; their objective is to investigate the biochemical and structural mechanism of the pathological effects of ethanol in order to improve diagnosis and treatment and to allow for early recognition through the development of biological markers and biochemical tests.  The trainees will be given the opportunity to acquire special skills in both clinical and basic research and to learn advanced techniques in biochemistry, molecular biology, pharmacology, electron microscopy, immunology, immuno cytochemistry, cell culture and experimental psychology.  In a 2-3 year apprenticeship with one or more of the senior investigators, the trainees will participate in projects selected on the basis of their interest and the relevance and interdisciplinary value of the question raised.  The trainees will attend and give seminars and special lectures in the field, contribute to literature (journal club) and manuscript reviews as well as grant applications, present papers at scientific meetings and acquire the skills needed to publish the research findings in reputable peer reviewed journals. These activities are carried out in an intellectual environment enriched by the presence of a score of international fellows, visiting professors and scientists on sabbaticals. The trainees will be selected on the basis of scholastic achievements, commitment to research in alcoholism and academic orientation.  The MD's will usually enter the program at the end of their clinical training (residencies in internal medicine or psychiatry).  This program is designed to encourage talented young individuals to enter the field of research on alcoholism and should prepare them to contribute successfully to the understanding and ability to handle alcohol problems.  Graduate students with clinical training will be allowed to spend 20 % of their time in clinical activities selected to allow them to maintain their acquired clinical skills. The trainees will have office and laboratory space at the Alcohol Research Center (Bronx Veterans Administration Medical Center), the Annenberg building of the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the laboratory of Dr. S. Fisher, North Shore Hospital, New York.  They will have access to a ten bed Medical Detoxification Unit (including an outpatient clinic), a Rehabilitation Unit (with a 20 bed ward and a clinic), supporting GI, Liver and Nutrition Units, as well as fully equipped biochemistry, pharmacology, immunology, molecular biology and electron microscopy laboratories.  Extensive animal facilities are available with rabbits, mice, rats, deermice, hamsters, baboons and common surgical suites and culture rooms. There are excellent library, computer and statistics support facilities at the Alcohol Research Ctr., the Bronx VA Medical Ctr., the North Shore Medical Ctr. and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.

This program provides an opportunity for a group of highly qualified students, selected from a national pool, to pursue the M.D. and Ph.D. degrees concurrently. The overall aim of the program is to provide training for outstanding future medical researchers. Each student is trained in the methodology and logic of basic research as well as the disciplines of medicine. Our expectation is that our trainees will enter careers in medical research and make significant advances in the understanding of human disease processes. A major goal of this program is to achieve a sufficiently large number of MSTP students in each medical school class to establish medical research as major career objectives at the University of Washington. There are several unique features of the program: (1) Our program emphasizes training in molecular biology and bioengineering. (2) New students begin a period of laboratory rotations prior to beginning the fist year medical school curriculum. (3) The second year medical school curriculum occupies mainly afternoons, leaving some mornings free for graduate courses. (4) MSTP students meet regularly on a monthly basis at the school or at faculty homes to present their research and to discuss their future directions. In this program the MSTP student is able to pursue an in-depth research project and medical school studies. Being more intense than either a medical or graduate school program, this experience provides a unique perspective and orientation to medical research. Our overall goal is to train a coterie of excellent students to translate basic molecular research into important medical discoveries. ",MEDICAL SCIENTIST TRAINING PROGRAM,,LAWRENCE A LOEB,1860313

 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for years       
 28-32 of GM07171 which supports the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP)      
 at Duke University. One of the first MSTP's, this Program has been continually     
 funded by the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences, the first ten       
 years as GM01678 (1966-1975) and the subsequent 26 years as GM07171                
 (1975-2001). The Program currently has an award of 36 funded positions and is      
 requesting the same number of slots in this renewal. However, the Program has      
 grown significantly since the previous application in 1996 when there were 42      
 students. Currently, there are 57 students and the Program will reach a new        
 steady state of 70-84 students. This number represents 10 to 12% of the Medical    
 School class. The additional funding is provided by the Medical and Graduate       
 Schools, the Duke Medical Alumni Association, and the Duke Endowment. In           
 addition, an $800,000 reserve fund has been created to cover unexpected            
 financial needs by the Program. As of this writing, 14 of 16 applicants            
 accepted by the Program have indicated their intention to matriculate here. The    
 current Program student body is quite diverse with 17.6% underrepresented          
 minority enrollment and a gender distribution that is 44% female. A large pool     
 of applicants (200-300 per year) has allowed us to recruit an outstanding group    
 of students. The structure of the Program is unchanged since the prior             
 application. It consists of a basic science core year, a clinical core year,       
 graduate school, and return to a final clinical year. The average program          
 length is 7.2 years. Students may spend their graduate years in the traditional    
 Medical School basic sciences, Chemistry, Zoology, and Biomedical Engineering.     
 Greater flexibility is now available to our students who may also opt a new        
 Biostatistics and Bioinformatics department, Economics, or Cognitive               
 Neuroscience/Psychology.

 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for years       
 28-32 of GM07171 which supports the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP)      
 at Duke University. One of the first MSTP's, this Program has been continually     
 funded by the National Institutes of General Medical Sciences, the first ten       
 years as GM01678 (1966-1975) and the subsequent 26 years as GM07171                
 (1975-2001). The Program currently has an award of 36 funded positions and is      
 requesting the same number of slots in this renewal. However, the Program has      
 grown significantly since the previous application in 1996 when there were 42      
 students. Currently, there are 57 students and the Program will reach a new        
 steady state of 70-84 students. This number represents 10 to 12% of the Medical    
 School class. The additional funding is provided by the Medical and Graduate       
 Schools, the Duke Medical Alumni Association, and the Duke Endowment. In           
 addition, an $800,000 reserve fund has been created to cover unexpected            
 financial needs by the Program. As of this writing, 14 of 16 applicants            
 accepted by the Program have indicated their intention to matriculate here. The    
 current Program student body is quite diverse with 17.6% underrepresented          
 minority enrollment and a gender distribution that is 44% female. A large pool     
 of applicants (200-300 per year) has allowed us to recruit an outstanding group    
 of students. The structure of the Program is unchanged since the prior             
 application. It consists of a basic science core year, a clinical core year,       
 graduate school, and return to a final clinical year. The average program          
 length is 7.2 years. Students may spend their graduate years in the traditional    
 Medical School basic sciences, Chemistry, Zoology, and Biomedical Engineering.     
 Greater flexibility is now available to our students who may also opt a new        
 Biostatistics and Bioinformatics department, Economics, or Cognitive               
 Neuroscience/Psychology.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cell and Molecular Biology Predoctoral
Training Program at the University of Pennsylvania is a University-wide,
interdepartmental and interschool program for careers in modern biology. The
group of trainers consists of approximately 300 senior and younger faculty from
many parts of the University. These faculty are members of the Cell and
Molecular Biology Graduate Group. Graduate Groups, which are interdepartmental
and interschool in membership and fully responsible for graduate education, are
not the same as or coextensive with Departments. Individual Graduate Groups set
requirements for degrees, admit and monitor the progress of students and
eventually certify their degrees. This somewhat unusual arrangement, whereby
graduate education is handled by Graduate Groups rather than Departments,
promotes interaction among the many faculty having common interests in cell and
molecular biology, and contributes strongly to the interdisciplinary spirit of
graduate training and collaborative research in these areas at the University
of Pennsylvania. The mission of the training grant is to support students with
broadly defined interests in cell and/or molecular biology during the first two
years of graduate training while they explore and refine their research
interests. In general, incoming students are appointed for two years, and
second year students are appointed for one year. Trainees are selected annually
by an open and democratic process. Trainees are required to take a rigorous
course in Cell Biology and Molecular Biology, attend the annual retreat of the
Cell and Molecular Biology Graduate Group, and participate in a weekly meeting
in which each trainee presents a seminar once a year on either their rotation
or thesis research. In addition, junior trainers present research seminars to
the trainees. Trainees also choose a topic for and organize an annual
symposium. The training program has formal mechanisms to monitor trainees both
during and after their support from the training grant. In addition, the
training program has formal mechanisms to monitor trainers, as well as to
resolve any conflicts between trainees and trainers.",Training Program in Cell and Molecular Biology,,RICHARD M SCHULTZ,1876102

The application seeks maintenance of the current level of funding (5 stipends per year) to serve as the core source of support for postdoctoral research training in diabetes and endocrinology at the Yale School of Medicine. The request is based on our record of attracting a strong applicant pool for this program, the high level of research productivity of the training faculty, and the continuing shortage of physician-scientists in both adult and pediatric endocrinology/diabetes. A major goal of the program is to develop physician-scientists who possess the requisite laboratory skills to pursue and compete effectively in academic medicine. Physician trainees entering the program will have an M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. degree and at least 2-3 years of clinical training in medicine or pediatrics. Ph.D. scientists are also recruited to the program since we believe their participation is critical to the training environment. Heavy emphasis in the selection process is given to those applications demonstrating potential and desiring research training for a career in clinical investigation. The duration of the training period is three years so as to provide a more in-depth training experience. The cornerstone of the curriculum involves the participation by the trainee in a specific laboratory project under the direction of a designated preceptor. The research projects offered span the gamut from clinical investigation to basic science and are designed to develop the laboratory skills required for a faculty appointment in internal medicine, pediatrics, or in a basic science department. The scope of the program has been expanded to provide the trainees with greater exposure to state-of-the-art laboratory techniques. Research opportunities are available in three major areas: 1) pathophysiology of diabetes, 2) immunology of diabetes, and 3) developmental and bone biology. Trainees have the opportunity to participate in ongoing projects involving collaborations with basic science departments in genetics, cell biology and immunobiology. Close interactions among preceptors within each programmatic area serve to further enrich the training experience. Instruction is also provided by means of an organized series of lectures, research seminars, and journal clubs. ",DIABETES MELLITUS AND DISORDERS OF METABOLISM,,ROBERT S SHERWIN,1882029

The underlying philosophy of this program will be to integrate training and research by creating an environment that facilitates the natural linkages among programs and departments throughout the University.  An extended period of research (2 years or more) will be provided to trainees under the mentorship of program faculty who will closely supervise and direct the academic career development of the trainee.  This program will provide an important mechanism for supporting trainees during a critical period of postgraduate medical training and provide an environment conducive to a research-oriented career.  During this time, trainees will be ""protected"" from clinical responsibilities and immersed in research to obtain the background and experience necessary to establish themselves an independent investigators in academic institutions.  The individual mentor will provide skills such as experimental design, data analysis, and manuscript and grant preparation during the training period. The goal of this program is to continue this history of productivity by creating an environment that will ensure that Duke will continue to contribute to the development of young investigators capable of pursuing successful research careers in cardiovascular fields.  The current application will describe the modifications and improvements that have been recently implemented and will discuss Duke""s ongoing commitment to train the next generation of cardiovascular researchers.

This training program was begun in 1975 and has provided training to 52 current or past postdoctoral scientists and physicians.  Of these, a large proportion are in academic medicine and many continue in clinical or basic science research.  During the current funding period, six trainees have been supported.  Of four who completed their training, two currently have academic positions and one has accepted a position for the beginning of the next academic year.  The program is centered in the Vascular Medicine Unit at the University of Rochester Medical Center but is interdepartmental with faculty from adult and pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Pharmacology and Physiology.  The program will be directed by Dr. Charles Francis, Chief of the Vascular Medicine Unit, assisted by an Executive Committee comprised of three of the faculty.  It will offer an intensive, focused, two or three year training experience in hematology research that will include didactic course work, lectures, informal seminars, a close mentoring relationship with a faculty member and a research project.  All trainees will complete a didactic training program provided by the Rochester Clinical Research Curriculum supported by a K30 award that will include principles of scientific writing; issues related to technology transfer, funding and industrial relations; and grant writing skills.  Trainees with an M.D. degree may pursue patient- oriented research and additional didactic course work in biostatistics, epidemiology, and outcomes research is available.  Either Ph.D. or M.D. trainees may pursue basic research in the laboratory of one of the faculty. Each trainee's program will be approved by the Executive Committee and monitored by the Training Committee.  The mentor relationship between faculty and trainee is emphasized, and the faculty are committed to providing necessary support, encouragement, and resources necessary to begin an independent investigative career.  Trainee candidates are typically recruited from the Hematology/Oncology fellowship programs and from Ph.D. candidates in the departments of Pathology, Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Pharmacology and Physiology.

Twenty-two training faculty, with expertise in a wide range of disciplines that converge on oral health and disease, are involved in the training program. It is designed  to   support  postdoctoral  trainees predominantly, with a minor component of training for research oriented undergraduate dental students. The majority of postdoctoral candidates will have  the DDS  degree and  will pursue PhD or MSD  degrees. The  remainder will be  PhD degree investigators particularly interested in salivary secretions or other oral biology research. PhD candidates  will  predominantly matriculate in the Department of Oral Biology although selection of another department represented by a training faculty member will be available. MSD candidates would matriculate  in oral pathology or oral medicine. All trainees would pursue the oral biology core curriculum plus  additional formal  classwork based  on  individual goals and interests. The program is to be administered  through the program director who will  work closely with the  Oral Biology Department Chairman, a co-program director for the program.  A steering committee, consisting of the full members of the Oral Biology  Department, will advise on accepting new  students and  recruitment activities, and will periodically review  each trainee's  progress and  make suggestions as appropriate.

 DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Applicant's Abstract): The present application is    
 for continued support for Research Training in Mental Health Epidemiology          
 (originally, Research Training in Psychosocial Epidemiology). The major goal of    
 the program is to provide rigorous training in the application of epidemiologic    
 methods to psychosocial and psychiatric research. Since its inception in 1975,     
 this program has had an unusual degree of stability in its core training           
 faculty and overall objectives. Students who have participated in this program     
 have demonstrated outstanding success in developing careers with important         
 contributions to psychiatric and psychosocial epidemiology. Dr. Stan Kasl has      
 been the Principal Investigator since 1975; however, Dr. Kathleen Merikangas       
 now will take over as Program Director and Dr. Kasl will become Co-Director.       
 The major components of the training include faculty mentoring, formal course      
 work in epidemiology, applied research experience, and clinical practica, where    
 relevant. The present application requests support for 4 pre-doctoral and 4        
 post-doctoral trainees. Trainees will be recruited to represent the following      
 focal areas: psychosocial epidemiology, psychiatric epidemiology, genetic          
 epidemiology, and biostatistics. The substantive areas of expertise in this        
 program include links between psychosocial risk factors, psychopathology and       
 chronic diseases, comorbidity of psychiatric disorders and substance abuse,        
 genetic epidemiology of behavioral and emotional disorders, and a new future       
 direction of prevention. Faculty interests cover all stages of the life span       
 ranging from childhood to late life. Strengths of this program include: (1) the    
 availability of an excellent formal academic program in the Department of          
 Epidemiology and Public Health including programs in Chronic Disease               
 Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and strong links with other departments including     
 Psychiatry, Psychology and Genetics; (2) an extensive network of ongoing           
 research in diverse areas and across all levels of epidemiology including          
 descriptive, analytic and intervention to provide direct experience in research    
 in psychiatric epidemiology; (3) an interdisciplinary faculty with extensive       
 experience in domains of relevance to psychiatric research including               
 epidemiology, biostatistics, genetics, health policy and services, clinical        
 psychiatry, clinical psychology, developmental psychology and sociology; and       
 (4) focus on four disciplinary areas and four specialty areas that are of          
 critical importance to advances in contemporary psychiatry. Formal training,       
 mentorship, and extensive research experience will provide trainees with the       
 requisite methodologic and substantive tools to conduct high quality research      
 in psychiatry. Exposure to diverse specialty areas both within and between the     
 current program and other ongoing training initiatives will provide a broader      
 perspective on the substantive areas of psychiatric research and appreciation      
 of the need for an interdisciplinary approach that is critical to future           
 progress in understanding the pathogenesis and impact of mental disorders.

The goal of the training program is to prepare highly            
qualified students for research careers in cellular and molecular biology.      
The program offers its trainees a large and diverse group of faculty            
research mentors (80) with projects in a number of cutting edge areas. It       
is organized to provide students with the collegiality and support of a         
departmental environment but also the flexibility to move easily across         
department lines and to choose research mentors from among all program          
faculty. Trainee research is supported by the outstanding facilities            
available at the University of Illinois.                                        
                                                                                
Students. The training program has proved to be an extremely valuable           
recruiting tool in attracting a highly qualified and geographically             
diverse group of students. We have significantly improved the                   
representation of minority students in the program and added a large new        
pool of students through a new department, Cell and Structural Biology.         
                                                                                
Faculty. We have maintained strength in the areas in which we have been         
strong traditionally and increased our strength in cell biology. An             
outstanding group of new faculty have been added to the program since the       
last renewal and we project continued faculty growth in cell and molecular      
biology.                                                                        
                                                                                
Program Design. The program would provide three years of support for 27         
students. The program has functioned to allow students full access to all       
the relevant faculty and facilities of the institution while providing          
them with the supportive atmosphere of relatively small departments. The        
program sets certain course requirements for all its students. It also          
mandates that all its students carry out research rotations and requires        
that at least one rotation be outside the major department. Students also       
organize and run an annual symposium and a monthly seminar series.              
                                                                                
Facilities. There has been a dramatic increase in the research space            
devoid to cell and molecular biology at UIUC. The Chemistry-Life Sciences       
Building (to be occupied in 1996) will provide new space to many more. We       
offer our trainees world class research support facilities in the               
Biotechnology Center (oligonucleotide and peptide synthesis, nucleotide         
and protein sequencing, amino acid analysis, production of hybridomas,          
polyclonal antibodies and transgenic animals, flow cytometry, fermentation      
and electron microscopy facilities), Chemical Sciences Laboratories (NMR,       
ESR, mass spectrometry, etc.), imaging (Beckman Institute), and computing       
(NCSA, SOLS network) facilities.

University of Pennsylvania is a University-wide, interdepartmental and          
interschool program for careers in modern biology.  The group of trainers       
consists of more than 100 senior and younger faculty from many parts of         
the University.  These faculty members, and the training they provide,          
are organized into Graduate Groups according to disciplines of interest.        
These Graduate Groups, which are interdepartmental and interschool in           
membership and fully responsible for graduate education, are not the same       
as or coextensive with Departments. Individual Graduate Groups set              
requirements for degrees, admit and monitor the progress of students, and       
eventually certify their degrees.  organizationally, two of the Graduate        
Groups that participate in this program are in the School of Arts and           
Sciences (Biology and Chemistry), and the remaining 10 Groups come under        
Biomedical Graduate Studies in the School of Medicine, which provides a         
central point for processing applications, keeping records, coordinating        
curricula and other activities of the individual Graduate Groups, and           
through which considerable University funding for student support is            
channeled.  This somewhat unusual arrangement, whereby graduate education       
is handled by Graduate Groups rather than Departments, promotes                 
interaction among the many faculty having common interests in cell and          
molecular biology, and, contributes strongly to the interdisciplinary           
spirit of graduate training and collaborative research in these areas at        
the University of Pennsylvania.  The Training Program in Cell and               
Molecular Biology is an important component in attempts to maximize             
interaction among students and faculty of various Departments.  Trainees        
meet together periodically and, approximately once per year, choose a           
topic for a special 1-2 day seminar, select and invite speakers, and            
otherwise organize all aspects of the seminar. only students working            
toward the Ph.D. degree are supported by this Training Program. In total,       
34 students were supported for part or all of the present year, out of          
a total pool of more than 300 matriculated Ph.D. students interested in         
cell and molecular biology.  Individual Graduate Groups differ somewhat         
in their procedures and methods used in training.  All use a mix of             
formal courses, pre-thesis laboratory rotations, seminars, and individual       
laboratory research work leading to a thesis.  Examination and                  
supervision of research progress are done by faculty committees,                
sometimes with the addition of persons from outside the University

in the biological sciences at Washington University has been provided by        
the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences. The Division is a unique       
and nationally recognized administrative structure, the key feature of          
which is the absence of any departmental predoctoral programs: all

Division was established with its own endowment more than 20 years ago in       
recognition of the increasingly interrelated nature of all aspects of           
research in the biomedical and biological sciences, and in order to             
facilitate cooperation among faculty in the interdisciplinary training of

It is in such a tradition that the current training grant is rooted; we         
intend to use the continuation of this training grant to promote the            
professional growth of students whose research interests lie in an              
interdisciplinary area of rapidly growing importance and productivity:          
cellular and molecular biology. In parallel we hope to foster interactions      
among faculty which in turn will provide unique research opportunities for

The training grant is administered by the Environmental Toxicology Center which is directed by Dr. Colin R. Jefcoate. The training program is actively managed by Dr. Jefcoate, the Program Director, and the Training Grant Committee. The committee is made up of six members selected from the 19 trainers from the program to serve three-year terms on a rotation basis. The committee also represents the special interest of the training grant with the Environmental Toxicology Center with respect to important training issues. The standing committees in the Center are responsible for standardized admission and curriculum activities. The standing committees are: Admission Committee, Graduate Achievement and Curriculum Committee and Steering Committee. The training faculty of the program consists of 19 individuals from 10 departments. All but four of them are also members of the Environmental Toxicology Center. In addition, most of them are also members of the proposed NIEHS Center for Developmental and Molecular Toxicology. The trainees will be educated in a curriculum involving biochemistry, genetics and cell biology disciplines. In addition to identifying immunotoxicology and neurotoxicology as new areas of toxicology during the last grant application, developmental toxicology will be developed as a new educational component for the trainees in this application. The application requests funding for eight predoctoral and two postdoctoral positions for five years. After admission to the program, predoctoral students typically select a mentor during the first semester rotation through three laboratories. The selection is based mainly on matching the interest between the student and the faculty as well as the funding support of the faculty. After selection of a laboratory, trainees typically work alongside a senior graduate student or postdoctoral associate who is working on a related topic. A research advisory committee will then be set up for each student. Trainees meet with advisors regularly, at least once per week to discuss course work and research. The curriculum for the NIEHS predoctoral trainees is being revised. Each of the required core courses: Toxicology I and II, Ecotoxicology and Chemicals in the Environment, has been or being revised. Each course is being established in a modular format with three one-credit modules. This revision is supposed to provide more flexibility for Ph.D. students. For example, it is under review that the NIEHS predoctoral trainees may take all modules of the two courses in Toxicology but only four or six modules from the other two core courses. The trainees will also take advanced courses: a two credit advanced course on Molecular Approaches to Toxicant Metabolism and two one credit Advanced Workshop courses. A new advanced course in Developmental Toxicology is being developed and the trainees are expected to take this course also. The remaining requirements for the trainees are six credits of Biochemistry and one credit/semester of Toxicology seminar. After completion of the courses, trainees will take a rigorous three-part Preliminary Examination. Their progress in research will be supervised by the Research Advisory Committee. A special training experience for the NIEHS postdoctoral trainees is that they meet regularly with a group of trainers and must write a proposal early in the support period for external support. These trainees present their research on a regular basis at the Environmental Toxicology Center evening meetings and at least once in the regular program seminar series. In addition, they submit a brief annual report on their research progress which stresses the toxicological relevance of the research.

The goal of the training program is to prepare highly            
qualified students for research careers in cellular and molecular biology.      
The program offers its trainees a large and diverse group of faculty            
research mentors (80) with projects in a number of cutting edge areas. It       
is organized to provide students with the collegiality and support of a         
departmental environment but also the flexibility to move easily across         
department lines and to choose research mentors from among all program          
faculty. Trainee research is supported by the outstanding facilities            
available at the University of Illinois.                                        
                                                                                
Students. The training program has proved to be an extremely valuable           
recruiting tool in attracting a highly qualified and geographically             
diverse group of students. We have significantly improved the                   
representation of minority students in the program and added a large new        
pool of students through a new department, Cell and Structural Biology.         
                                                                                
Faculty. We have maintained strength in the areas in which we have been         
strong traditionally and increased our strength in cell biology. An             
outstanding group of new faculty have been added to the program since the       
last renewal and we project continued faculty growth in cell and molecular      
biology.                                                                        
                                                                                
Program Design. The program would provide three years of support for 27         
students. The program has functioned to allow students full access to all       
the relevant faculty and facilities of the institution while providing          
them with the supportive atmosphere of relatively small departments. The        
program sets certain course requirements for all its students. It also          
mandates that all its students carry out research rotations and requires        
that at least one rotation be outside the major department. Students also       
organize and run an annual symposium and a monthly seminar series.              
                                                                                
Facilities. There has been a dramatic increase in the research space            
devoid to cell and molecular biology at UIUC. The Chemistry-Life Sciences       
Building (to be occupied in 1996) will provide new space to many more. We       
offer our trainees world class research support facilities in the               
Biotechnology Center (oligonucleotide and peptide synthesis, nucleotide         
and protein sequencing, amino acid analysis, production of hybridomas,          
polyclonal antibodies and transgenic animals, flow cytometry, fermentation      
and electron microscopy facilities), Chemical Sciences Laboratories (NMR,       
ESR, mass spectrometry, etc.), imaging (Beckman Institute), and computing       
(NCSA, SOLS network) facilities.

University of Pennsylvania is a University-wide, interdepartmental and          
interschool program for careers in modern biology.  The group of trainers       
consists of more than 100 senior and younger faculty from many parts of         
the University.  These faculty members, and the training they provide,          
are organized into Graduate Groups according to disciplines of interest.        
These Graduate Groups, which are interdepartmental and interschool in           
membership and fully responsible for graduate education, are not the same       
as or coextensive with Departments. Individual Graduate Groups set              
requirements for degrees, admit and monitor the progress of students, and       
eventually certify their degrees.  organizationally, two of the Graduate        
Groups that participate in this program are in the School of Arts and           
Sciences (Biology and Chemistry), and the remaining 10 Groups come under        
Biomedical Graduate Studies in the School of Medicine, which provides a         
central point for processing applications, keeping records, coordinating        
curricula and other activities of the individual Graduate Groups, and           
through which considerable University funding for student support is            
channeled.  This somewhat unusual arrangement, whereby graduate education       
is handled by Graduate Groups rather than Departments, promotes                 
interaction among the many faculty having common interests in cell and          
molecular biology, and, contributes strongly to the interdisciplinary           
spirit of graduate training and collaborative research in these areas at        
the University of Pennsylvania.  The Training Program in Cell and               
Molecular Biology is an important component in attempts to maximize             
interaction among students and faculty of various Departments.  Trainees        
meet together periodically and, approximately once per year, choose a           
topic for a special 1-2 day seminar, select and invite speakers, and            
otherwise organize all aspects of the seminar. only students working            
toward the Ph.D. degree are supported by this Training Program. In total,       
34 students were supported for part or all of the present year, out of          
a total pool of more than 300 matriculated Ph.D. students interested in         
cell and molecular biology.  Individual Graduate Groups differ somewhat         
in their procedures and methods used in training.  All use a mix of             
formal courses, pre-thesis laboratory rotations, seminars, and individual       
laboratory research work leading to a thesis.  Examination and                  
supervision of research progress are done by faculty committees,                
sometimes with the addition of persons from outside the University

and Molecular Biology within the Division of Biology and Biomedical             
Sciences at Washington University.  Since 1973, all predoctoral education       
in the biological sciences at Washington University has been provided by        
the Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences. The Division is a unique       
and nationally recognized administrative structure, the key feature of          
which is the absence of any departmental predoctoral programs: all              
predoctoral programs and degree-granting units in the biological sciences       
at this university are both interdisciplinary and interdepartmental. The        
Division was established with its own endowment more than 20 years ago in       
recognition of the increasingly interrelated nature of all aspects of           
research in the biomedical and biological sciences, and in order to             
facilitate cooperation among faculty in the interdisciplinary training of       
prospective biological scientists.                                              
                                                                                
It is in such a tradition that the current training grant is rooted; we         
intend to use the continuation of this training grant to promote the            
professional growth of students whose research interests lie in an              
interdisciplinary area of rapidly growing importance and productivity:          
cellular and molecular biology. In parallel we hope to foster interactions      
among faculty which in turn will provide unique research opportunities for      
students.

The  purpose of the program is to provide multi-disciplinary  training in salivary secretion biology  as it  relates to oral  health and disease.  The goal is to train researchers, primarily at the postdoctoral level, to become effective investigators of both basic mechanisms of secretion and the  pathology associated with  different diseases involving oral tissues. Twenty-two training faculty, with expertise in a wide range of disciplines that converge on oral health and disease, are involved in the training program. It is designed  to   support  postdoctoral  trainees predominantly, with a minor component of training for research oriented undergraduate dental students. The majority of postdoctoral candidates will have  the DDS  degree and  will pursue PhD or MSD  degrees. The  remainder will be  PhD degree investigators particularly interested in salivary secretions or other oral biology research. PhD candidates  will  predominantly matriculate in the Department of Oral Biology although selection of another department represented by a training faculty member will be available. MSD candidates would matriculate  in oral pathology or oral medicine. All trainees would pursue the oral biology core curriculum plus  additional formal  classwork based  on  individual goals and interests. The program is to be administered  through the program director who will  work closely with the  Oral Biology Department Chairman, a co-program director for the program.  A steering committee, consisting of the full members of the Oral Biology  Department, will advise on accepting new  students and  recruitment activities, and will periodically review  each trainee's  progress and  make suggestions as appropriate.

multidisciplinary program o predoctoral training in neuroscience at the         
University of California, Berkeley. The goal of the training program is to      
teach graduate students to become productive research scientists and            
teachers across the broad disciplines of neuroscience. The 36                   
participating faculty are drawn from across the entire Berkeley campus and      
represent neuroscience research from the molecular and cellular, to neural      
systems, computation, and cognition. Participating departments include the      
Department of Molecular and Cell Biology (including the Divisions of            
Neurobiology, Cell and Developmental Biology, Genetics, and Biochemistry        
and Molecular Biology), Psychology, Vision Science Optometry, chemistry,        
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Environmental Science.         
Students can be admitted to the program through the Ph.D. programs of any       
of the participating departments.                                               
                                                                                
The program is designed to provide training across the entire range of          
neuroscience through required course work and lab experience. During year       
01, students are exposed to the entire field in a survey course, and are        
required to spend 3 consecutive 10 week periods rotating through different      
laboratories of their choice across the campus. Students also attend            
presentations by faculty members describing research opportunities, the         
annual Neuroscience Program Retreat, and the weekly Neuroscience Seminar        
Series. At the end of the third rotation, students select a laboratory in       
which to conduct their thesis research. During year 02, students begin to       
concentrate on their research; they also take lecture/seminar courses and       
begin to acquire teaching experience by serving as a teaching assistant.        
At the end of the second year, students take their oral qualifying exams.       
In years 3-5, students concentrate on their research projects, continue to      
teach and take advanced seminar courses in areas of relevance to their          
thesis topic.                                                                   
                                                                                
Applicants to the program typically have outstanding undergraduate records      
in the biological, chemical or physical sciences. Admission is based on         
evaluation of previous scholastic achievement, prior research performance,      
scores on GRE tests, statement of purpose and letters of recommendation.        
Only candidates in the top 20% are accepted. The training record of this        
program over the past 10 years indicates that almost 95% of the trainees        
have one on to productive careers in biomedical research.

undergraduate Medical students at the State University of New York at
Buffalo, builds upon an existing program developed over the past five
years.  It is placed largely outside the core curriculum and complementary
to it.  Students will obtain factual knowledge of basic cancer biology and
an appreciation for how research, epidemiology, prevention, and nutrition
influence the clinical management of cancer patients.

In this proposal, year programs are comprised of a series of special
Oncology selectives, electives, and student assistantships.  An inter-year
program, of direct benefit to all students will include restructuring of
the Buffalo Cancer Syllabus, an Oncology Resource library, and
self-instructional module development.  Integration of nutrition,
epidemiology and prevention concepts, in all programs, will be a major
goal.  Systematic evaluation will be carried out.

The first year program consists of selectives and case presentations which
may accommodate at least one-third of the entering Freshman class.  The
selectives, one in general oncology, one in cancer prevention, will consist
of seminars and group discussions focusing on issues such as basic biology,
clinical presentation, prevention, epidemiology, and nutrition in cancer.
Interdisciplinary case presentations will be open to all students.  The
second year program will consist of student assistantships in the summers
preceding or following the sophomore year and will focus on research
methodologies applied to both the basic and clinical investigation of
cancer.  The third year program will build upon established cancer, and
cancer prevention, selectives in which students are exposed to basic
research and clinical problems that directly inter-relate.  To attract
senior students, the fourth year program will consist of oncology electives
reorganized to present relevant meterial.  A new oncology elective will
focus on the care of the ambulatory cancer patient, including various
support needs and community resources.  This new elective will be
coordinated with a number of community support and a cancer prevention
program coordinated through a regional HMO.

The Buffalo Cancer Syllabus, developed during the previous grant, will be
modified to meet the special needs of junior and senior medical students
and special nutrition, prevention, and epidemiology sections will be
developed.  An oncology education resource library will be developed for
use by students and faculty.

undergraduate Medical students at the State University of New York at
Buffalo, builds upon an existing program developed over the past five
years.  It is placed largely outside the core curriculum and complementary
to it.  Students will obtain factual knowledge of basic cancer biology and
an appreciation for how research, epidemiology, prevention, and nutrition
influence the clinical management of cancer patients.

In this proposal, year programs are comprised of a series of special
Oncology selectives, electives, and student assistantships.  An inter-year
program, of direct benefit to all students will include restructuring of
the Buffalo Cancer Syllabus, an Oncology Resource library, and
self-instructional module development.  Integration of nutrition,
epidemiology and prevention concepts, in all programs, will be a major
goal.  Systematic evaluation will be carried out.

The first year program consists of selectives and case presentations which
may accommodate at least one-third of the entering Freshman class.  The
selectives, one in general oncology, one in cancer prevention, will consist
of seminars and group discussions focusing on issues such as basic biology,
clinical presentation, prevention, epidemiology, and nutrition in cancer.
Interdisciplinary case presentations will be open to all students.  The
second year program will consist of student assistantships in the summers
preceding or following the sophomore year and will focus on research
methodologies applied to both the basic and clinical investigation of
cancer.  The third year program will build upon established cancer, and
cancer prevention, selectives in which students are exposed to basic
research and clinical problems that directly inter-relate.  To attract
senior students, the fourth year program will consist of oncology electives
reorganized to present relevant meterial.  A new oncology elective will
focus on the care of the ambulatory cancer patient, including various
support needs and community resources.  This new elective will be
coordinated with a number of community support and a cancer prevention
program coordinated through a regional HMO.

The Buffalo Cancer Syllabus, developed during the previous grant, will be
modified to meet the special needs of junior and senior medical students
and special nutrition, prevention, and epidemiology sections will be
developed.  An oncology education resource library will be developed for
use by students and faculty.

BACKGROUND  
  
This toxicology program at Vanderbilt began in the 1970s.  The focus of the training has changed over the years. Initially, the focus was on practical toxicology of pesticides, metals, and other hazardous chemicals.  During the 1970s, the focus moved to biochemical toxicology.  Since the 1980s, the emphasis has been on molecular toxicology with a recent focus on the integration of clinical themes.  Originally, the Training Program was housed in the Department of Biochemistry.  However, over time the program became interdepartmental.  Currently, there are 22 mentors for this Training Program with primary appointments within the Departments of Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Pathology, Pediatrics, Pharmacology, and Medicine. The Training Program has a long history of training individuals who go on to have productive careers in academia, research institutes, and industry.

Funds are requested to support eight pre-doctoral (Ph.D. candidates) and six postdoctoral trainees in the Training Program in Environmental Toxicology, the long-standing training component of the Center in Molecular Toxicology at Vanderbilt University. This interdisciplinary program provides research career training in molecular aspects of toxicology related to environmental health. Because the field is inherently interdisciplinary, research training in the program spans chemistry, biochemistry, chemical biology, structural biology, analytical technology, functional genomics, pathogen-host interactions, disease pathology, and exposure science. The faculty preceptors have appointments in the departments of Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Biomedical Informatics, Chemistry, Medicine, Neurology, Pathology/Microbiology/Immunology, Pediatrics, and Pharmacology, all of whom train doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows. Training is achieved through basic and specialized coursework, research rotations, dissertation research, and participation in seminars, journal clubs, and joint research meetings. A distinctive feature of the Program is hands-on training on diverse technology platforms through a highly developed and open system of research facility cores at Vanderbilt. Graduate students are recruited to the Department of Chemistry through departmental mechanisms, with assistance from the Center in Molecular Toxicology. In the medical school departments, graduate students are initially recruited into either the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Biomedical and Biological Sciences or the Quantitative and Chemical Biology Program, where they spend the first 9 months in a common core curriculum and do laboratory rotations. Graduate students are supported for the first year by these programs. Students then are recruited into the Training Program in Environmental Toxicology from these first-year pools, and training program support begins in the second year. Both pre-doctoral and postdoctoral trainees are selected by the Training Program Advisory Committee, with guidelines to ensure distribution of trainees and monitoring of progress. The list of preceptors includes 18 faculty members who are all Investigators in the Center in Molecular Toxicology. Major research areas in the Center include oxidative damage, DNA damage and repair, maintenance of genomic integrity, enzymatic biotransformation and reactions of electrophiles, neurotoxicology, respiratory disease pathophysiology, systems biology, and pathogen-host interactions. Graduates from the program have been highly successful in academia, industry, and other professional settings and include leaders in the field.",Training Program in Environmental Toxicology,"Public Health Relevance: This interdisciplinary program has a long-standing and successful history of training scientists for careers in molecular toxicology as applied to environmental health.

properties of the estrogen receptor and its role in regulating normal and
abnormal uterine growth and reproductive function.  We have described the
mechanism by which estradiol-binding modulates the equilibrium between the
nonactive and the active states of the estrogen receptor.  The estrogen
receptor exists in two forms or states:  the nonactive, 4S monomer, which
has a lower affinity for estradiol and rapid estradiol dissociation
kinetics; and the activated, 5S receptor dimer, which has a higher affinity
for estradiol and slower estradiol dissociation kinetics.  Equilibrium
between these two forms of the estrogen receptor induces a posibively
cooperative equilibrium binding of estradiol.  Since there is only limited
information on several crucial aspects of the biochemistry of the estrogen
receptor, we propose:  1) A careful kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of
the interactions between the receptor and tritiated and nontriatiated
potent agonists (estradiol, diethylstilbestrol), weak estrogens (estrone,
estroil) and estrogenic antagonists (clomiphene, tamoxifen,
hydroxytamoxifen, and LY117018).  The relationship between the receptor's
binding kinetics with each of these compounds and their biological activity
will be compared.  2) Characterization and kinetics of the DNA binding
properties of activated as compared with nonactivated forms of the estrogen
receptor.  The role of estrogen-binding by the receptor on the receptor's
DNA binding interactions will be investigated.  3) Estrogen affinity
chromatography will be used to purify the estrogen receptor from calf
uteri, and its molecular properties will then be described.  4) Monoclonal
antibodies will be prepared as a probe for the receptor's biochemistry.

immediate specific aims are:  (1) to determine whether the affinity
of the estrogen receptor for its estrogen responsive element (ERE),
a specific nucleotide sequence of the prolactin gene, controls the
selectivity of the receptor for specific genes.  The in vitro
affinity of the estrogen receptor for the ERE and the in vivo
response to estradiol will be measured after site-directed in vitro
mutagenesis of the ERE.  The affinity of the receptor for the DNA
will be measured by the gel mobility assay.  The ERE's will be
linked to the thymidine kinase promoter linked to the
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene.  The plasmid constructs
will be transfected into GH3 cells and responsiveness to estradiol
measured.  (2) The affinity of the antiestrogen receptor complexes
for the ERE and mutant EREs will be measured to determine whether
the antiestrogens change the interaction and selectivity of the
receptor, so that the receptor interacts with other genes.  (3)
Isolate and characterize DNA-binding protein(s) that bind at or

structure, function, and regulation of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase     
(PDH) multi-enzyme complex.  The PDH complex is localized to the                
mitochondria, where it plays a critical role in regulating cellular fuel        
utilization.  The activity of the mammalian PDH complex is regulated            
primarily by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, catalyzed by a specific     
PDH kinase and a PDH phosphatase, respectively.  PDH phosphatase (PDP) is a     
heterodimer consisting of a Mg2+-dependent and Ca2+-stimulated catalytic        
subunit (PDPc) and a flavoprotein (PDPr).  PDH phosphatase activity is          
stimulated by insulin in several tissues, particularly in adipose tissue.  A    
critical outstanding issue is how the signal is transferred from the insulin    
receptor in the plasma membrane to the PDH phosphatase within the               
mitochondrial membrane-matrix compartment.  Recent observations suggest that    
PDPr may be involved in this signaling pathway.  The proposed studies seek      
to elucidate the nature and regulation of the mammalian PDH phosphatase and     
the macromolecular organization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDH complex,    
which is a good model for the mammalian PDH complex.  The specific aims are:    
(1) elucidate the nature and function of the regulatory subunit (PDPr) of       
bovine PDH phosphatase and (2) determine the number and localization of         
binding sites for the E3-binding protein and for pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1)

this localization.  The role(s) of PDPr on the catalytic activity, substrate    
specificity, and divalent cation requirements of PDP will be assessed using     
recombinant PDPc and PDPr and native PDH phosphatase:  the function, if any     
of FAD in PDPr will be determined and the domain structure of PDPr will be      
delineated.  Enzymic assays, equilibrium dialysis, limited proteolysis, and     
deletion mutagenesis will be used.  Protein-protein interaction between E2,     
E3BP, and E1 will be assessed by protein engineering and binding studies in     
conjunction with cryoelectron microscopy and image reconstruction.

immediate specific aims are:  (1) to determine whether the affinity

selectivity of the receptor for specific genes.  The in vitro
affinity of the estrogen receptor for the ERE and the in vivo
response to estradiol will be measured after site-directed in vitro
mutagenesis of the ERE.  The affinity of the receptor for the DNA
will be measured by the gel mobility assay.  The ERE's will be
linked to the thymidine kinase promoter linked to the
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene.  The plasmid constructs
will be transfected into GH3 cells and responsiveness to estradiol
measured.  (2) The affinity of the antiestrogen receptor complexes
for the ERE and mutant EREs will be measured to determine whether
the antiestrogens change the interaction and selectivity of the
receptor, so that the receptor interacts with other genes.  (3)
Isolate and characterize DNA-binding protein(s) that bind at or
near the ERE of the prolactin gene whose binding is dependent
upon/or modified by the presence of the purified estrogen receptor.
(4) Identify and characterize the in vivo phosphorylation sites of
the estrogen receptor in calf uteri and MCF-7 cells. Determine the
effects of receptor phosphorylation on the receptor's estrogen-

 growth and reproductive functions.  The estrogens, as well as the
 estrogenic antagonists mediate their biological actions by their
 interactions with the estrogen receptor.  The estrogen receptor in turn
 regulates the transcriptional activity of estrogen responsive genes by
 its interactions with specific DNA sequence of these genes referred to as
 the estrogen responsive elements (ERE).  The long term goal of this
 research program is to elucidate the mechanism of estrogen and estrogenic
 antagonist interactions with the estrogen receptor, and to gain insight
 into the structure-function relationship of the receptor.  The estrogen
 receptor is phosphorylated in an estrogen dependent manner immediately
 before or after binding to an ERE and as a consequence the gene's
 transcriptional activity is promoted.  A major gap in our knowledge and
 the focus of this research program is to describe the mechanism(s) by
 which the estrogen dependent phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor
 regulates the receptor's transcriptional function.  Our working model is
 that as a consequence of phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor the
 receptor affinity for its ERE is increased and/or changes the
 conformation of the estrogen receptor-ERE complexes in such a way to
 promote transcriptional activity.  We will identify which crucial
 serine(s) of the estrogen receptor is (are) phosphorylated in an estrogen
 dependent manner We intend to characterize and identify the specific
 protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of the receptor.  The
 in vivo transcriptional activity of the crucial serine(s) that is
 phosphorylated will be assessed using site-directed mutagenesis of the

structure, function, and regulation of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase     
(PDH) multi-enzyme complex.  The PDH complex is localized to the                
mitochondria, where it plays a critical role in regulating cellular fuel        
utilization.  The activity of the mammalian PDH complex is regulated            
primarily by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, catalyzed by a specific     
PDH kinase and a PDH phosphatase, respectively.  PDH phosphatase (PDP) is a     
heterodimer consisting of a Mg2+-dependent and Ca2+-stimulated catalytic        
subunit (PDPc) and a flavoprotein (PDPr).  PDH phosphatase activity is          
stimulated by insulin in several tissues, particularly in adipose tissue.  A    
critical outstanding issue is how the signal is transferred from the insulin    
receptor in the plasma membrane to the PDH phosphatase within the               
mitochondrial membrane-matrix compartment.  Recent observations suggest that    
PDPr may be involved in this signaling pathway.  The proposed studies seek      
to elucidate the nature and regulation of the mammalian PDH phosphatase and     
the macromolecular organization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PDH complex,    
which is a good model for the mammalian PDH complex.  The specific aims are:    
(1) elucidate the nature and function of the regulatory subunit (PDPr) of       
bovine PDH phosphatase and (2) determine the number and localization of         
binding sites for the E3-binding protein and for pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1)    
on the icosahedral acetyltransferase (E2) and the functional significance of    
this localization.  The role(s) of PDPr on the catalytic activity, substrate    
specificity, and divalent cation requirements of PDP will be assessed using     
recombinant PDPc and PDPr and native PDH phosphatase:  the function, if any     
of FAD in PDPr will be determined and the domain structure of PDPr will be      
delineated.  Enzymic assays, equilibrium dialysis, limited proteolysis, and     
deletion mutagenesis will be used.  Protein-protein interaction between E2,     
E3BP, and E1 will be assessed by protein engineering and binding studies in     
conjunction with cryoelectron microscopy and image reconstruction.

regulates the transcriptional activity of estrogen responsive genes by
its interactions with specific DNA sequence of these genes referred to as

that as a consequence of phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor the
receptor affinity for its ERE is increased and/or changes the

promote transcriptional activity.  We will identify which crucial

growth and reproductive functions.  The estrogens, as well as the
estrogenic antagonists mediate their biological actions by their
interactions with the estrogen receptor.  The estrogen receptor in turn
regulates the transcriptional activity of estrogen responsive genes by
its interactions with specific DNA sequence of these genes referred to as
the estrogen responsive elements (ERE).  The long term goal of this
research program is to elucidate the mechanism of estrogen and estrogenic
antagonist interactions with the estrogen receptor, and to gain insight
into the structure-function relationship of the receptor.  The estrogen
receptor is phosphorylated in an estrogen dependent manner immediately
before or after binding to an ERE and as a consequence the gene's
transcriptional activity is promoted.  A major gap in our knowledge and
the focus of this research program is to describe the mechanism(s) by
which the estrogen dependent phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor
regulates the receptor's transcriptional function.  Our working model is
that as a consequence of phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor the
receptor affinity for its ERE is increased and/or changes the
conformation of the estrogen receptor-ERE complexes in such a way to
promote transcriptional activity.  We will identify which crucial
serine(s) of the estrogen receptor is (are) phosphorylated in an estrogen
dependent manner We intend to characterize and identify the specific
protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of the receptor.  The
in vivo transcriptional activity of the crucial serine(s) that is
phosphorylated will be assessed using site-directed mutagenesis of the
specific serine(s).  We will determine whether phosphorylation of the
estrogen receptor influences its interaction with the ERE to antagonists
to promote transcriptional activation. The ability of estrogens and
estrogenic antagonists to phosphorylate the crucial serine(s) will be
determined by [32p] labeling  of the estrogen receptor in MCF-7 cells
followed by receptor purification and SDS-gel electrophoresis.  HPLC
isolation of the [32p]labeled tryptic peptide(s) and gas-phase
microsequencing of the peptide(s) will be used to identify the crucial
serine(s) that is phosphorylated in a hormone dependent manner.  These
studies will provide a test of our model and an important insight into a
key step by which the estrogen receptor regulates gene transcription.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IFT, Intraflagellar Transport, discovered in Chlamydomonas in our laboratory, is essential for the assembly and maintenance of almost all eukaryotic cilia and flagella. Studies of the genes involved in IFT and its mechanism have led to new findings on the role of cilia/flagella (interchangeable terms) in many pathologies where the role of cilia was heretofore unsuspected. Because ciliary signaling processes, and their receptors on the ciliary membrane, are key to many of these pathologies, the proposed research is directed at determining how channels/receptors are targeted to the flagellar membrane, and to the flagellar axoneme through a proposed flagellar pore structure, and how IFT is involved in this transit process. We will determine, for the first time, the high resolution ultrastructure of the IFT particles both in situ and as isolated particles with Cryo-EM. Because there is mounting evidence, from our laboratory and others, that the cilium is involved in the control of the cell cycle, one of our most important goals is to determine the molecular interactions between one of the IFT polypeptides, a small G protein, and the cell cycle. Finally, one of our initial aims, 40 years ago, in establishing systems of cilia and flagellar regeneration, was to study how the cell recognizes the lack of its flagella and up-regulates hundreds of genes rapidly after flagellar detachment; we will determine what cytoplasmic factors are responsible for this transcriptional up-regulation.

infections) and/or abnormal signaling (e.g. polycystic kidney disease, blindness). Such ciliopathies can
result from improper assembly of cilia; therefore, understanding how ciliary precursors are brought to the
cilium and into the ciliary compartment may shed new light on their role in disease. How essential
structural components are delivered from their site of synthesis to the ciliary axoneme, is a mystery. To
address this issue a novel preparation of vesicles has been isolated during flagellar assembly from the
cytoplasm of Chlamydomonas, a pivotal organism for the study of assembly and function of cilia. These
vesicles carry ciliary membrane proteins (e.g. CrPKD2) as well as components of the ciliary axoneme,
including tubulin and radial spoke proteins. Combining high resolution imaging, proteomics and RNAi
knockdown, the hypothesis that axonemal proteins are transported to the cilium via peripheral
attachment to vesicles targeted to the periciliary membrane is being tested. Once at the base of the
cilium, the flagellar transition zone (TZ) is involved in determining which proteins enter/exit the flagellar
compartment. Many proteins involved in ciliopathies are found in the TZ. To further characterize the
composition of the TZ, TZs of Chlamydomonas have been isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry.
Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins, which are involved in membrane
dynamics, were identified in this analysis, heralding a previously unknown function of the TZ, which will be
studied. These proteins may be involved in removing ubiquitinated proteins from the cilium, the release of
ciliary membrane into the surrounding milieu, or in the severing of the organelle from the cell - three poorly
understood processes known to occur in cilia. Additional newly identified proteins of the TZ that are

We will use X-ray crystallography to obtain high-resolution structures of mutant Thermus thermophilus 30S subunits that reveal new conformational states. We will examine the effects of the mutations on the accuracy and kinetics of decoding. Our second aim is to probe a pathway by which codon recognition is signaled via ribosomal protein S12 and aminoacyl-tRNA to EF-Tu to activate GTP hydrolysis, a key step in the tRNA selection process. These experiments are designed to provide fundamental insights into ribosome structure and function, including new conformational states of the ribosome, to aid in understanding the decoding process. The ability to solve structures of ribosomes with antibiotic-resistance mutations will aid in understanding the mechanisms of antibiotic action and resistance, and has particular clinical relevance for the rational design of drugs to fight resistant microbial pathogens.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PROJECT NARRATIVE: The goal of this project is to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of protein synthesis at the atomic level, using the methods of structural biology, genetics and biochemistry. Protein synthesis in bacteria is the target of over half of all antibiotics, and modifications and mutations in components involved of this process can lead to antibiotic resistance, one of the most pressing medical problems of our time. Deciphering the molecular basis for antibiotic resistance will provide important information needed for the rational design of novel antimicrobial agents effective against antibiotic resistant microorganisms. A more comprehensive examination of the structural basis for protein synthesis will also provide important insights into one of the most fundamental processes found in all forms of life.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary objective of the proposed training program in reproductive biology (RBTP) is to continue offering predoctoral and postdoctoral training to individuals who demonstrate potential for developing into independent investigators in the field of reproductive biology. The renewal application by including multidisciplinary interests expands the horizon of training for students. This will better prepare their career paths in the 21st century and present them with opportunities to make significant scientific contribution to reproductive biology. This renewal application focuses on the current excitement in scientific innovations, opportunities and advances in biomedical sciences with evolving technologies. The proposed RBTP has been developed within the current mission of the NIH roadmap to multidisciplinary approaches to research endeavors. This mission can best be accomplished if students are trained in an environment where specific biological problems are addressed using contemporary knowledge in developmental biology, physiological genomics, proteomics, signal transduction, and molecular and cellular biology. The present environment at Vanderbilt is highly conducive to such training due to a broad based interactive group of 13 investigators spanning several departments and thematic areas, and the recent establishment of genomics, proteomics, lipidomics and imaging centers on the campus with state-of-the-art facilities. Training will occur with major emphasis in: 1) gametogenesis, sperm functions and fertilization, (Greenstein, Olson, Drummond-Barbosa and Waterman); 2) uterine biology (Das, Dey, Ong and Paria); 3) embryogenesis, development and implantation (Das, Dey, Chiang, Lee and Paria); and 4) genetic regulation of gonadotropin secretion (Phillips). These areas of research training require the infusion and active participation of preceptors who are experts in developmental biology, signal transductions, genomics and proteomics (Lee, Caprioli, and Sealy).

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One of the most dramatic advances in biomedical research in the past 15 years has been the demonstration that human disorders can be studied in model organisms. This is a tribute to the investment of our country in basic biology. Genetic organisms such as yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans, and the mouse have led the way, but the organism par excellence for the study of thyroid hormone, one of the most important hormones for human health, is the amphibian, Xenopus laevis. Although vertebrates in all of the various phyla including humans require thyroid hormone (TH) to complete their life cycle, by far the most dramatic example is the role of TH in amphibian metamorphosis. TH is required absolutely for all of the remarkable changes that convert a tadpole into a frog. Many features of TH biology are identical in all vertebrates. However, the ease with which the model amphibian organism, X. laevis can be raised in the laboratory, the ability to manipulate TH levels, and the abundance of the material all make X. laevis the best model organism to study the action of TH. The mere addition of TH to the rearing water induces all of the events of metamorphosis. TH controls cell death, cell proliferation, and the remodeling of organs. Modem genetic methods are being applied to X. laevis with great success beginning with the new sperm mediated transgenesis technique of Kroll and Amaya. By expressing genes or mutant genes that interfere with metamorphosis in specific cell types the TH-controlled developmental program of a single cell type can be inhibited or activated selectively. The expression of detrimental gene products can be activated in cells at precise times in development utilizing controllable promoters. This wonderful old biological problem that previously could only be described by scientists is now yielding to modem molecular methods.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program deals with basic mechanisms of transcription and with transcriptional regulation of the activities of genes. Its implications for human health relate to the development application of precise and specific interventions in gene expression that are based on a broad and fundamental understanding of transcription mechanisms as well as their associated protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions.  The proposed experiments deal with two transcription systems. Projects dealing with eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerase III pursue the following objectives: 1) precisely delineate the major binding site for the Bdp1 subunit of the transcription factor (TF)IIIB; 2) devise a perfectly symmetric (i.e. palindromic) DNA site for TFIIIB; 3) explore new TBP-Brf1 fusion proteins in assembly of transcriptionally functional TFIIIB; 4) probe the structure of transcription initiating promoter complexes and transcript-elongating transcription complexes by RNA protein cross-linking to answer specific questions about the role of the Brf1 subunit of TFIIIB in initiation of transcription, transcript elongation, rapid polymerase recycling and coupling between transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processing; 5) probe the structure of the RNA polymerase III surface by protein-protein cross-linking to answer specific questions about the locations of five specified subunits and about the TFIIIB-polymerase III contact surface; 6) use chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) to determine occupancy of selected RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes by TFIIIB, TFIIIC and RNA polymerase III, as well as kinetics of change of occupancy upon selective disruption of RNA polymerase III transcription; 7) dissect the mechanism that directs DNA transposition by the retrovirus-like Ty3 transposable element to RNA polymerase III promoters by interaction with TFIIIB (in collaboration); 8) analyze RNA polymerase III transcription through obstructing nucleosomes (in collaboration).  A parallel group of projects deals with a regulatory system that couples transcription to concurrent genome replication in bacteria. The activator of this regulatory system is a sliding clamp protein; a specific RNA polymerase-bound co-activator is also required. The principal projects pursue the following objectives: 1) determine the mode of attachment of the co-activator to RNA polymerase and associated protein secondary structure changes; 2) determine whether the co-activator functions only in initiation of transcription or whether it remains attached to RNA polymerase throughout transcription; 3) dissect the architecture of this transcription regulatory system and its relationship to the architecture and function of bacterial sigma initiation factors by means of an extensive series of recombinant constructions, targeted mutagenesis and protein domain fusions.

 DESCRIPTION (adapted from applicant's abstract): The long-term objective is an     
 understanding of the mechanism of protein-mediated reactions on cell surfaces      
 by using newly developed pre-steady-state transient kinetic techniques. The        
 proteins are the neurotransmitter receptors at the junction between about          
 10(12) cells of the mammalian nervous system and the transport proteins that       
 remove the neurotransmitters from these junctions, thus terminating the            
 reactions. The specific aims are to determine the reaction mechanisms of these     
 proteins. What are the rate and equilibrium constants of the reactions and how     
 are they affected by disease-causing mutations of the proteins, therapeutically    
 useful compounds, and abused drugs? The principal investigator will investigate    
 the excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine and glutamate receptors, the inhibitory     
 gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor, and the dopamine transporter. Among       
 the compounds that inhibit or activate these proteins are the anti-convulsant      
 MK-801, the abused drug cocaine, neurosteroids, and combinatorially synthesized    
 RNA ligands that inhibit or prevent inhibition. The principal investigator will    
 investigate the mechanism of a GABA receptor reported to function abnormally in    
 the hippocampus of epilepsy-prone rats. Once one understands the mechanisms one    
 can explore the selection of compounds that counteract receptor malfunction.       
 Health Relatedness of the Project: Neurotransmitter receptors regulate             
 intercellular communication in the central nervous system and provide the          
 mechanism by which environmental information is received, stored, and              
 transmitted. They are implicated in nervous system diseases (e.g., epilepsy,       
 Parkinson's) and are the targets of therapeutic agents (for instance               
 anti-convulsants, tranquilizers) and abused drugs. An understanding of their       
 effects on the protein-mediated reaction mechanisms can lead to the rational       
 clinical treatment of diseases and the design of improved drugs. Research          
 Design: The principal investigator will use both the steady-state                  
 single-channel current-recording technique and the pre-steady-state kinetic        
 techniques newly developed by this laboratory. The new transient kinetic           
 techniques for use with membrane-bound proteins are suitable for studying          
 reactions on cell surfaces in the us-ms time region. Receptors are equilibrated    
 with a photolabile, biologically inert neurotransmitter precursor before           
 photolysis releases the neurotransmitter in us, thereby initiating the             
 reaction. The resulting whole-cell current due to opening of receptor-channels     
 or dopamine uptake is recorded and analyzed. Using combinatorially synthesized     
 RNA ligands for specific sites on the membrane-bound proteins, the principal       
 investigator will test predictions arising from the mechanism based on the         
 kinetic measurements. The ligands are isolated by a technique developed by the     
 principal investigator's laboratory.

This phenomenon has been termed homeostasis, buffering, robustness and canalization. It is becoming possible to investigate these concepts at a molecular level. Recent results indicate that molecular circuits are designed to minimize the phenotypic consequences of perturbation, a process we will term ""buffering"". We propose to develop paradigms and methods for understanding how genetic variation is buffered using the DNA replication and dNTP synthesis circuits of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae as test cases. Understanding such buffering mechanisms is important to three broad areas of biology: (1) how genetic variation, the material of evolution, is accumulated in a species; (2) which genes influence the phenotypic expression of genetic variability, for example in the highly variable presentation of human disease in different individuals; and (3) the design principles of biological systems. Our specific aims are the following: 1. Design and employ methods to control the quantity of specific essential proteins in the DNA replication machinery and dNTP biosynthesis pathway. 2. Comprehensively identify the nonessential proteins that influence the capacity of the cell to withstand reduced expression of key essential proteins. 3. Compare the buffering capacity contributed by specific proteins quantitatively and assign them to different epistasis groups. 4. Explore differences among natural isolates of S. cerevisiae in their buffering mechanisms. ",GENETIC ANALYSIS OF THE EUKARYOTIC CELL CYCLE,,LELAND H HARTWELL,6249948

research grants from NIDA.                                                      
                                                                                
The basic research strategy is to use behavioral methodologies as               
bioassays of drug interactions with their neuronal substrates in order to       
identify and characterize components of drug action that might be relevant      
to potential for abuse and to related phenomena, such as tolerance and          
physical dependence. Representative compounds will be studied over a range      
of doses in several complementary behavioral procedures, such as drug           
discrimination, locomotor activity, autotitration of reinforcement              
threshold for electrical stimulation of the brain, and drug-induced             
turning. Established collaborations with faculty colleagues will bring          
additional methodologies to bear on the research questions of interest.         
Most experiments will be performed on rats, some on squirrel monkeys.           
This approach will help in the interpretation of experimental findings by       
indicating their generality with respect to pharmacological, behavioral,        
and species variables.                                                          
                                                                                
The proposed experiments will address several hypotheses. Among them are:       
1)Brain opioid systems can, under some conditions, modulate brain dopamine      
systems and behavioral effects of drugs that are mediated by dopamine. 2)       
Single-dose opioid agonist-induced sensitization to effects of antagonists      
is a model of acute physical dependence. 3) Discriminative effects of low       
and high doses of caffeine model, respectively, positive and negative mood      
states induced by caffeine in humans. 4) Brain dopamine systems mediate         
some behavioral effects of caffeine and tolerance to those effects,             
sometimes as a result of adenosine-receptor blockade.

technical and, most important, intellectual skills necessary for careers

elementary steps of the reactions, information needed to understand the         
regulation of signal transmission between the approximately 10(12) cells        
in the human nervous system. Specific aims are to: 1. Determine reaction        
mechanisms of excitatory acetylcholine and glutamate and inhibitory GABA        
and glycine receptors. The knowledge gained is required to account for          
the integration of excitatory and inhibitory signals by a single cell.          
2. Understand the modification of receptor function by therapeutic

Receptors in cells and genetically engineered forms expressed in X.

pharyngeal pumping, in the nematode C elegans. Neurotransmitters secreted       
by specific cells and responding receptors in target cells will be              
identified. Health Relatedness of the Project: Neurotransmitter receptors       
regulate intercellular communication in the central nervous system and          
provide the mechanism by which environmental information is received,           
stored, and transmitted. They are implicated in nervous system diseases         
(Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) and are the targets of therapeutic agents (for       
instance, Prozac(TM), tranquilizers) and abused drugs. Understanding how        
receptor-mediated reaction mechanisms are modified is required for              
rational clinical treatment of diseases and the design of improved drugs.       
Research Design: Rapid reaction techniques, newly developed by this group       
and suitable for studying reactions on cell surfaces in the mu s-ms time        
region, will be used. Receptors are equilibrated with a photolabile,            
biologically inert neurotransmitter precursor before photolysis releases        
the neurotransmitter in mu s, thereby initiating the reaction. The              
resulting whole-cell current due to opening of receptor-channels is             
recorded and analyzed. This technique is used in combination with a cell-       
flow technique with a 5-ms time resolution. This approach overcomes the         
limitations of previous techniques with inadequate time resolution that         
has hampered research in this area during the last 40 years and can be          
used with intact single cells, oocytes, and circuits of cells.

genetic approaches, we have cloned genes tht are regulated in respect to

transferrin receptor, surface antigen 4F2, and surface antigen S11.  The

such sequences and propose experiments by which their biological
significance can be evaluated.  If our hypothesis is correct that these
genes regulate pattern formation in mammals, then we shall have a genetic
approach to studying mechanisms of morphogenesis in higher organisms.  In
another new system (sr = segregation regulation), we shall investigate
genetic factors located on the mammalian X chromosome that control
chromosome segregation in hybrid cells.  We postulate that this system
represents a hitherto unrecognized mechanism that mediates intercellular

synthase and acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase.  The acyl DHAP pathway has been
shown to play a role in the biosynthesis of glycerolipids, especially the
containing ether linkages (glycerol-ether lipids and plasmalogens).  In
recent years, a number of discoveries such as the presence of acyl DHAP
pathway enzymes in microbodies (peroxisomes and microperoxisomes), the
demonstration that in patients with Zellweger cerebrohepatorenal syndrome
both the microbodies and glycerol-ether lipids are absent, and the
discovery that an ether lipid (platelet activating factor), has a potent
biomessenger role, all point towards the importance of the acyl DHAP
pathway in lipid metabolism.  In the proposed studies, our aim is to purify
the membrane-bound acyl DHAP pathway enzymes to homogeneity and study in
detail their properties and reaction mechanisms.  Attempts will be made to
raise specific antibodies against these enzymes and then to use these
antibodies to estimate and to localize the enzymes in different tissues.
The activity of these enzymes under different physiological conditions and
the contributions of the acyl DHAP pathway to the biosynthesis of non-ether
glycerolipids will be studied.  Different analogs of acyl/alkyl DHAP will
be chemically synthesized to test their possible use as inhibitors or
substrates for different enzymes.  The role of ether lipids will be
investigated by studying their distribution, turnover, and transport in
different systems.  The incorporation of exogenously added ether lipid
precursors to membrane lipids of skin fibroblasts from Zellweger syndrome

in the regeneration of two 12Mu flagella in 90 min.  Deflagellation induces
a large increase in the synthesis and accumulation of flagellar protein
mRNAs.  These mRNAs rapidly fall back to pre-deflagellation levels once
regeneration is complete, and this is due both to a decrease in synthesis
and a shortening of mRNA half-life.  Only detachment of the flagella is
required for these events, as they will occur normally if flagellar
regeneration is blocked (colchicine).  The system is ideal for
investigating the signals responsible for the coordinate control of gene
transcription, translational controls, and problems of organelle protein
assembly.  Transcriptional control of the alpha-tubulin genes is being
investigated by injecting constructs of the tubulin gene promotor DNA and
chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene (CAT) into the Xenopus oocyte
nucleus and assaying for CAT.  Proteins isolated from Chlamydomonas nuclei
or cytoplasm are being coinjected with the constructs; they are identified
as putative transcriptional control proteins by in vitro protein/DNA
binding studies using DNA from the alpha-tubulin promotor region.  In
addition to the alpha and beta tubulin genes which have already been cloned
and sequenced, we are isolating genes for radial link and dynein-ATPase
peptides by use of polyclonal antibodies to these proteins and a lambda
gt11 expression vector containing Chlamydomonas genomic DNA.  The radial
link genes and their 5' flanking regions will be sequenced and analyzed for
commonalities.  Radial link genes will also be used in studies on the
transformation of paralyzed radial link mutants to the motile wild-type.
Since tubulin mRNA half-life decreases upon completion of regeneration, the
stability of radiolabeled in vitro-synthesized (SP6) tubulin mRNA will be
examined in the reticulocyte lysate and by injection of the mRNA into
Xenopus oocyte cytoplasm.  Both flagellar alpha-tubulin mRNAs appear to be
synthesized in response to deflagellation, but only one is used for
flagellar protein synthesis.  This apparent translational control will be
analyzed using in vitro-synthesized tubulin mRNAs and the reticulocyte
lysate; we will determine if the alpha tubulin mRNA which is not used for
flagellar tubulin synthesis is used for the synthesis of mitotic tubulin.
Other evidence suggests that the amount of tubulin dimers in the cell can
control the amount of tubulin mRNA present.  We will experimentally vary
the amount of tubulin dimers in the pool and analyze the changes in tubulin
mRNA synthesis and accumulation.  The mechanism by which this control might
be exerted will be investigated by RNA/protein cross linking studies.
There is no feed back control between the amount of mRNA synthesized in
responses to deflagellation and the amount already present.  In studies on
flagellar protein assembly, we will determine the role of the alpha-tubulin
acetylation which occurs at the time of tubulin assembly at the flagellar
tip.  The possible role of acetylation in microtubule assembly/disassembly
in vitro will be investigated as will be the calcium sensitivity of
acetylated microtubules.  The flagellar dynein-ATPase is prefabricated in
the cytoplasm during flagellar regeneration and we will use dynein mutants
to describe the steps in the assembly of the dynein polypeptides.

can catalyze numerous types of genome rearrangements and thus have been
implicated in germline mutations (important for evolution) and somatic cell

Transcription initiation is the first step in gene expression.  We will be
studying how promoter structure (the DNA sequence recognized by RNA
polymerase) affects this process.  We will also be examining how regulatory
protein-DNA interactions and competitive RNA polymerase-DNA interactions
modulate this process.  Translation initiation is also a crucial step in
gene expression in which the rate of protein systhesis from a particular

associated changes.  Accordingly, the proposed research will test the
hypothesis that when the onset and progression of hypertension occur during
middle or late life the left ventricle develops structural and functional
abnormalities which are exacerbated by prolonged periods of hypertension.
We will study two age groups of rats with renovascular (Goldblatt, two

hypothesis that some left ventricular abnormalities may not be reversible
when hypertension develops late in life we will also study animals
following the reversal of hypertension with antihypertensive therapy.  Left
ventricular performance will be assessed by measuring indices of cardiac
output during acutely increased preload.  To delineate specific alterations
in subcellular components of the myocardial cell which may underlie
functional changes, electron and light microscopy and morphometry will be
employed, and the subepi- and subendo-cardial regions of the left ventricle
compared.  Because it is recognized that the coronary vasculature and
circulation may be adversely affected by hypertension and/or myocardial
hypertrophy, regional and total myocardial perfusion will be measured at
rest and during maximal vasodilation, and coronary reserve estimated.  As a
corollary to the perfusion studies the extensiveness of the capillary bed
and the structure of the coronary arteries will be evaluated by microscopy
and image analysis.  To determine whether any of the alterations

will also employ rats with mineralcorticoid hypertension in some of the

constituents (apoproteins, triacylglycerol, cholesterol, and phospholipids)
of very low density lipoprotein are assembled and translocated and to
determine how these processes and subsequent secretion are regulated.  To
determine the mechanism(s) by which acetyl-CoA carboxylase--the key
regulatory enzyme of fatty synthesis, hence de novo lipogenesis--is
controlled.

The estrogen-induced chick hepatocyte in monolayer culture, a system
developed in this laboratory, will serve as experimental model.  The chick
hepatocyte is ideally suited for studies on VLDL synthesis and secretion,
since the liver accounts for nearly all de novo fatty acid synthesis in the
chick, as it dies in man, and provides the major fraction of the fatty
acids utilized by other tissues (including adipose tissue) in the form of
VLDL -triacylglycerol, and since VLDL output of the hepatocyte in culture
can be increased 10-20-fold by prior hormone treatment.  We have already
amassed a large body of background information with this system.

The sequence of events will be determined by which apoproteins and lipids
are assembled to form the nascent VLDL particle.

The intracellular sites of these events will be identified and
characterized.

Using puromycin-induced nascent chain release, the interaction of segments
of the apo-B polypeptide and specific VLDL lipids will be established.

A cell-free system will be developed that is capable of assembling,
processing and translocating nascent VLDL.

This cell-free system will be used to investigate the minimal requirements
of and the mechanisms of key steps in the VLDL assembly/processing pathway.

cDNA clones which encode the mRNA for apo-B will be isolated and sequenced.

The regulatory mechanisms for the synthesis, assembly, translocation and
secretion of VLDL will be investigated.

The effect of the phosphorylation state of acetyl-CoA carboxylase on the
kinetics of its citrate-induced activation and polymerization and the state
of its protomerpolymer equilibrium will be determined.

1. Analyis of the acute actions of a regulatory peptide:

clonal strains of pituitary cells and will examine the nature of the
biochemical linkage between the TRH receptor and polyphosphatidylinositol
hydrolysis, the mechanisms used by the cell for mobilization of
intracellulr Ca2+, characterization of membrane cation channels, and the
roles of protein kinase C and protein phosphorylation in acute actions of
TRH on hormone (prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH)) secretion.

2. Actions of tumor-promoting phorbol esters on differentiated functions.
Phorbol esters will be localized in cells by a new immunohistochemical
approach, and the mechanisms by which phorbol esters modulate plasma
membrane receptors and regulate acute protein secretion (PRL and GH) will
be investigated.  3.  Regulation of specific protein synthesis.  Using a
highly differentiated cell culture system in which the biosynthesis of PRL
and GH is controlled by hormones, Ca2+, and tumor promoters, I shall
investigate the biochemical and molecular mechanisms by which phorbol
esters and TRH regulate the biosynthesis of PRL and GH, and the role of
Ca2+ in the regulatory pathway.  The results of these studies will
contribute new knowledge on the details of regulation of 2 important

to the better understanding of certain disorders of growth (including
cancer) and reproductive function.

elements are genetic entities that are widespread throughout nature which
can catalyze numerous types of genome rearrangements and thus have been
implicated in germline mutations (important for evolution) and somatic cell
mutations (important in oncogenesis).  Our projects will use genetic and
biochemical approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanism of illegitimate
recombination encoded by one model system--the bacterial transposon Tn5.
Transcription initiation is the first step in gene expression.  We will be
studying how promoter structure (the DNA sequence recognized by RNA
polymerase) affects this process.  We will also be examining how regulatory
protein-DNA interactions and competitive RNA polymerase-DNA interactions
modulate this process.  Translation initiation is also a crucial step in
gene expression in which the rate of protein systhesis from a particular
mRNA is modualted.  The structure (both 1 degree and 2 degree) of the mRNA
is an important determinant of the rate of this process.  We will analyze

be purified.  The interaction of the large DNA-binding transcription factor

and maintain their content of water and small ions.  The experiments are
divided into two parts.  The first involves dog red blood cells, in which
movements of sodium, calcium, protons, and potassium across the membrane
are strongly dependent on cell volume.  The proposed work seeks to examine
the nature of the stimulus-response coupling, so as to clarify how certain
membrane transporters are turned on and off by minor degrees of cell
shrinkage or swelling.  Methods will involve the use of cross-linking
agents, membrane-expanding treatments, and selective proteolyic digestion
to influence the relationship between cell volume and ion transport.
Membrane protein separations will be performed by gel electrophoresis,
using cells that have had specific transporters ""turned on"" or ""turned off""

monitor transport.

The second project is a one-year, preliminary study designed to evaluate,
by the techniques of electron probe microanalysis, a unifying hypothesis
that would explain the generation of dense, viscous red blood cells in
sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis, and other hemolytic states.
The hypothesis states that red blood cells in all these conditions are
subject to fragmentation or budding.  The vesicles that bud off the cells
are believed to be richer in water and salts and poorer in hemoglobin
content than the parent cells, thus leaving the latter dense, viscous, and
poorly deformable.  The work proposed here involves a one year feasibility
study during which red blood cell fragments produced in vitro would be
assayed for ion, water, and hemoglobin content by standard techniques of
atomic absorption and/or flame photometry.  The same fragments would be
subjected to electron probe microanalysis, to determine whether the method
has the sensitivity and specificity to approach the problem with blood
samples from patients.  The hypothesis cannot be evaluated in the blood of
patients in any other way than by electron probe microanalysis:  this is
because cell fragments in the circulation may originate from platelets,
leukocytes, and possibly other non-red cell sources.  Only by combining the
techniques of electron microscopy and microanalysis can one be sure of the
origin of the fragments in which quantitative elemental determinations are
to be made.

this country.  A theme central to the entire research program is that
through systematic and comprehensive behavioral studies it will be possible
to characterize the bases of drug actions at the neuronal level.

Representative opioid alkaloids--agonists, agonist/antagonists, and
antagonists--will be studied in several behavioral procedures, notably,
drug discrimination, food-reinforced operant responding (punishment
paradigm), and locomotor activity, and in at least two animal species, rat
and squirrel monkey for optimal assessment of the generality of
experimental findings.  Emphasis will be placed on clarifying the role of
endogenous opioid peptides in the diverseness of the behavioral effects of
opioid alkaloids.  Behavioral effects of peptides will be determined after
central administration, their effects compared to those of prototypic
alkaloids, and interactions studied between peptides administered centrally
and alkaloids administered systemically.

The effects of chronic caffeine administration will be characterized by an
integrated behavioral and neurochemical approach.  Most studies will be
performed on rats receiving caffeine daily by scheduled access to water
bottles containing the drug.  Matched controls will receive drug-free tap
water.  Rate and extent of tolerance development, and time course for loss

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term objective of this grant proposal is to understand how the ribosome functions at the atomic level during protein synthesis. Our approach includes developing genetic and biochemical systems in the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus to construct and isolate mutants in rRNA, ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Our first aim is to characterize wild-type T. thermophilus ribosomes in solution by structure probing and determine modified residues by mass spectrometry. This will serve as the baseline for subsequent analysis of mutants in rRNA and ribosomal proteins. Selected mutants will be identified for crystallization attempts. A second aim is to investigate the nature of interactions between the ribosome and elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G during accommodation and translocation. Selected functional sites in both subunits will be probed. A model for conformational change during translocation will be evaluated as will the mechanism of translocation inhibition by tuberactinomycin antibiotics. A third aim will probe our collection of mutants in the peptidyltransferase active site of 23S rRNA of T. thermophilus to characterize functions in addition to peptide bond formation associated with this region, including translocation, decoding and peptide release. Fast kinetic experiments will be used to evaluate the mutants and test a model of accommodation, and the peptide antibiotic negamycin will be examined for its role in termination. These experiments should provide fundamental insights into ribosome structure-function relationships, different conformational states of the ribosome during translation and the mode of action of and resistance to clinically useful antibiotics.

focus on intraflagellar transport (IFT), a motility characterized by the        
rapid anterograde and retrograde movement of particles between the              
flagellar membrane and axoneme.  IFT particles are composed of ca. 15           
polypeptides, the genes for which are being cloned.  Mutations in C.            
elegans homologues of 3 of these polypeptides have been identified that         
result in defects in assembly of cilia found on sensory dendrites.              
Likewise, mutations in the microtubule motors that power anterograde and        
retrograde IFT in Chlamydomonas and their homologues in C. elegans              
result in the inability to assemble functional flagella or sensory              
cilia.  IFT is, therefore, one of the only microtubule-based motilities         
in which mutants are available in both the anterograde and retrograde

vertebrate retinal rod inner-outer segments, and kinesins, homologous           
to those associated with IFT, have been localized to this region. These

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One of the most dramatic advances in biomedical research in the past 15 years has been the demonstration that human disorders can be studied in model organisms. This is a tribute to the investment of our country in basic biology. Genetic organisms such as yeast, Drosophila, C. elegans, and the mouse have led the way, but the organism par excellence for the study of thyroid hormone, one of the most important hormones for human health, is the amphibian, Xenopus laevis. Although vertebrates in all of the various phyla including humans require thyroid hormone (TH) to complete their life cycle, by far the most dramatic example is the role of TH in amphibian metamorphosis. TH is required absolutely for all of the remarkable changes that convert a tadpole into a frog. Many features of TH biology are identical in all vertebrates. However, the ease with which the model amphibian organism, X. laevis can be raised in the laboratory, the ability to manipulate TH levels, and the abundance of the material all make X. laevis the best model organism to study the action of TH. The mere addition of TH to the rearing water induces all of the events of metamorphosis. TH controls cell death, cell proliferation, and the remodeling of organs. Modem genetic methods are being applied to X. laevis with great success beginning with the new sperm mediated transgenesis technique of Kroll and Amaya. By expressing genes or mutant genes that interfere with metamorphosis in specific cell types the TH-controlled developmental program of a single cell type can be inhibited or activated selectively. The expression of detrimental gene products can be activated in cells at precise times in development utilizing controllable promoters. This wonderful old biological problem that previously could only be described by scientists is now yielding to modem molecular methods.

We propose to develop paradigms and methods for understanding how genetic variation is buffered using the DNA replication and dNTP synthesis circuits of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae as test cases. Understanding such buffering mechanisms is important to three broad areas of biology: (1) how genetic variation, the material of evolution, is accumulated in a species; (2) which genes influence the phenotypic expression of genetic variability, for example in the highly variable presentation of human disease in different individuals; and (3) the design principles of biological systems. Our specific aims are the following: 1. Design and employ methods to control the quantity of specific essential proteins in the DNA replication machinery and dNTP biosynthesis pathway. 2. Comprehensively identify the nonessential proteins that influence the capacity of the cell to withstand reduced expression of key essential proteins. 3.

This phenomenon has been termed homeostasis, buffering, robustness and canalization. It is becoming possible to investigate these concepts at a molecular level. Recent results indicate that molecular circuits are designed to minimize the phenotypic consequences of perturbation, a process we will term ""buffering"". We propose to develop paradigms and methods for understanding how genetic variation is buffered using the DNA replication and dNTP synthesis circuits of the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae as test cases. Understanding such buffering mechanisms is important to three broad areas of biology: (1) how genetic variation, the material of evolution, is accumulated in a species; (2) which genes influence the phenotypic expression of genetic variability, for example in the highly variable presentation of human disease in different individuals; and (3) the design principles of biological systems. Our specific aims are the following: 1. Design and employ methods to control the quantity of specific essential proteins in the DNA replication machinery and dNTP biosynthesis pathway. 2. Comprehensively identify the nonessential proteins that influence the capacity of the cell to withstand reduced expression of key essential proteins. 3. Compare the buffering capacity contributed by specific proteins quantitatively and assign them to different epistasis groups. 4.

 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research focuses on enzymes      
 that play central roles in the regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.       
 Metabolite flux through the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways in liver         
 determines the level of serum glucose. Hence, a thorough understanding of          
 regulatory phenomena associated with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis should         
 facilitate the development of new therapies in the treatment of diabetes. The      
 goal here is a complete description of the dynamics of ligand interactions and     
 the molecular mechanisms of catalytic/regulatory actions associated with human     
 hexokinase I and porcine fructose-i 6-bisphosphatase. Hexokinase I is broadly      
 distributed amongst tissues, and is the predominant isoform in the brain and       
 the red blood cell. The isoform of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase under               
 investigation here predominates in liver. An engineered form of hexokinase I       
 will permit the determination by NMR spectroscopy of the equilibrium constant      
 governing its central kinetic complex. Specific mutants at ligand binding sites    
 should reveal key factors governing interactions between hexokinase I and the      
 mitochondrion. A proposed model for the allosteric regulation of catalysis in      
 hexokinase I will be tested by directed mutation. Predicted outcomes of            
 specific mutations will be verified by steady-state kinetics and structure         
 determinations by X-ray diffraction. Novel constructs of fructose-I                
 ,6-bisphosphatase, which combine subunits of different functional properties       
 into a single tetramer, should reveal the basis of cooperative phenomena in        
 ligand binding and kinetics. Stopped-flow fluorescence of an engineered            
 fructose-1 ,6-bisphosphatase should determine whether the enzyme under             
 conditions of kinetics assays exists in an oligomeric state other than that of     
 a tetramer. Molecular models for allosteric inhibition, ligand binding             
 synergism, and catalysis proposed for fructose-1 ,6-bisphosphatase will be         
 tested by directed mutations and follow-up investigations in fluorescence          
 spectroscopy, steady state kinetics, NMR spectroscopy and structure                
 determinations from single crystals. Finally, the significance and                 
 physiological relevance of a newly discovered allosteric effector site on          
 fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase will be investigated by techniques of steady-state     
 kinetics, fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, directed mutation and       
 X-ray crystallography.

These changes are controlled by thyroid hormone (TH). Metamorphosis is a remarkably tractable developmental system since the diverse changes can be induced precociously with exogenous TH or inhibited pharmacologically with well known ""goitrogens"" added to the rearing water. Many features of TH physiology are the same in all vertebrates including the negative feedback loop between the thyroid gland the pituitary, the remarkable similarity in the TH receptors (TR), their RCR partners, and the DNA elements (TRE) to which these receptors bind. We have developed a three phase strategy to study individual programs of metamorphosis. First, we identified genes that are up- and down-regulated by TH in the tail, limb, intestine, and a cultured cell by means of a subtractive hybridization method that has the added power of estimating the number of genes in each program. We have concentrated our attention on the simplest program, tail resorption, in which we isolated about half of the TH-induced up- and down-regulated genes (17 and 4, respectively) clues about their possible roles in the resorption program. This grant application deals with the third phase which is underway, namely assaying genes for functional role in metamorphosis. The recent discovery of a transgenesis method for Xenopus laevis has provided us with such an assay. The function of the TH response gene in metamorphoses can be assessed as well as the various receptors, co-activators, and o-repressors that are presumed to play a role in the ability of TH to alter gene expression. Of special interest is an examination of the role of unliganded thyroid receptor in suppressing metamorphic changes. The participation of various hormones other than TH that have been implicated in amphibian metamorphosis is being assessed. The molecular explanation for many well documented biological features of metamorphosis such as the onset of competence to respond to TH, the different chronology of tissue response to the hormone (heterochrony) can be studied from a new perspective. We have already observed instructive phenotypes by over-expressing genes that inhibit metamorphosis. Strategies are described that can take advantage of these phenotypes and elucidate developmental pathways. ",AMPHIBIAN METAMORPHOSIS--A DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAM,,DONALD D BROWN,1898460

extrinsic perturbations to DNA.  We assume that the RAD9 pathway transduces     
a signal from incompletely replicated or damaged DNA to inhibit a component

Identify new checkpoints that we believe to be responsible for enforcing        
other dependent relationships in the mitotic cycle and for ensuring the         
high fidelity of mitotic chromosome transmission using the logic and

the immediate, coordinate upregulation of over 200 genes encoding

and their assembly into new flagella.  This project is directed toward          
determining (a) where in the cytoplasm the mRNAs encoding these                 
flagellar proteins are located and where these proteins are synthesized;        
(b) to what extent these polypeptides are pre-assembled in the cytoplasm

targeted to the flagella; (d) the role of the basal body/centriole in           
this targeting process; and (e) how, once in the flagella, the                  
precursors are transported to the assembly site at the flagellar tips.          
Using a variety of assembly mutants, these studies examine the                  
synthesis, assembly and transport of flagellar radial spokes, which are         
complexes composed of 17 polypeptides that pre-assemble in the                  
cytoplasm, yet function solely in the flagella.  Studies on transport           
focus on intraflagellar transport (IFT), a motility characterized by the        
rapid anterograde and retrograde movement of particles between the              
flagellar membrane and axoneme.  IFT particles are composed of ca. 15           
polypeptides, the genes for which are being cloned.  Mutations in C.            
elegans homologues of 3 of these polypeptides have been identified that         
result in defects in assembly of cilia found on sensory dendrites.              
Likewise, mutations in the microtubule motors that power anterograde and        
retrograde IFT in Chlamydomonas and their homologues in C. elegans              
result in the inability to assemble functional flagella or sensory              
cilia.  IFT is, therefore, one of the only microtubule-based motilities         
in which mutants are available in both the anterograde and retrograde           
transport of defined, isolable particles.  Particles, ultrastructurally         
similar to IFT particles, are found in the connecting cilium of                 
vertebrate retinal rod inner-outer segments, and kinesins, homologous           
to those associated with IFT, have been localized to this region. These         
observations suggest that IFT is universally required for assembly and          
maintenance of both motile and non-motile sensory cilia and, therefore,

that affect every tissue and organ of the tadpole.  The process is              
controlled entirely by thyroid hormone (TH).  The goal of this project is       
to understand at a molecular level how one hormone can initiate so many         
different developmental programs and to elucidate the molecular details of      
a few of these programs.  The experimental strategy has three phases:           
first, the isolation of up and down regulated gene in several programs,         
second, the identification of regulated genes by sequencing and comparison      
with the public data base, and third, the determination of the role of          
these genes in the developmental program.  During the past 5 years we have      
completed the first two phases, and in this proposal we outline functional      
assays for the many genes that we have identified.  In the course of these      
experiments it has become apparent that amphibian metamorphosis is a            
superb model system for the study of TH action at the molecular level.          
These studies will provide information relevant to the various questions        
addressed by researchers who have used exclusively mammals and chickens as      
their experimental organisms.  The hormone receptors are the same, and the      
general pattern of their expression is similar.  The well known negative        
feedback loop between the thyroid and pituitary glands in mammals actually      
develops during metamorphosis.  The amphibian system is far easier to           
manipulate than chickens and mammals as will become evident from the body       
of this application.  Because of the accessibility of the system and our        
development of a powerful subtractive hybridization method (the ""gene           
expression screen""), large numbers of TH regulated genes have been              
identified in tadpoles far in excess of all the TH regulated genes              
combined that have been found in other organisms.  This prompts a               
reexamination of the thyroid response elements (TRE) and some classic           
questions about the molecular basis of TH action.  In addition, TH induced      
metamorphosis provides a novel way to study vertebrate organogenesis since      
the characteristic organ changes can be induced at will by the                  
experimenter simply by adding exogenous hormone to a competent tadpole.         
In Th-induced metamorphosis the expression of a predetermined program is        
studied.  However, we are now analyzing two related complex developmental       
systems designed to find genes that set up the programs.  These two             
systems are tail regeneration and the homeotic transformation from tail to      
limb induced by retinoic acid.  These systems are examples of important         
biological events controlled by changes in gene expression that are not         
subject to genetic analysis but can be studied by this three phase              
approach.  The affect of any hormone on its target tissue, the action of        
drugs that work by affecting gene expression, and the comparison of genes       
expressed in a variety of diseased versus normal tissues are candidates         
for this kind of analysis.

form cytoplasmic pre-assembly aggregates prior to their transport to the        
flagellum.  To examine the assembly of spoke proteins onto the axoneme,         
RSPs obtained from cytoplasmic and flagellar extracts will be assembled         
onto axonemes isolated from mutants lacking entire spokes or spoke heads.       
We will continue to characterize the axonemal binding domain of RSP3 in

these motors.                                                                   
                                                                                
While investigating motors that may power IFT, we have determined that a        
kinesin-like protein (Klpl), the cDNA of which we have cloned and               
sequenced, is localized to only one of the two central pair microtubules of     
the flagellar axoneme.  We will clone and sequence the other kinesins we        
have identified in Chlamydomonas flagella and localize these proteins with      
specific antibody probes.  Since the central-pair microtubules are thought      
to rotate during flagellar beating, we will examine Klpl motility in vitro      
assays, testing for directionality and the ability to rotate microtubules.      
Proteins that interact with Klpl will be identified by non-denaturing           
immunoprecipitation with the Klpl antibody.  In addition, Klpl cDNAs will       
be mutagenized in vitro, and expressed in Chlamydomonas, to determine the       
functional role of this kinesin in vivo.

program of research is proposed for studying behavioral effects of two          
types of drugs of significant clinical, social, and theoretical                 
importance: 1) opioids, some of which have long represented a serious           
abuse problem; 2) caffeine, the most widely consumed behaviorally-active        
drug in the world, which has features that make it a convenient model           
""drug of abuse"". The proposed experiments will be supported by two              
research grants from NIDA.                                                      
                                                                                
The basic research strategy is to use behavioral methodologies as               
bioassays of drug interactions with their neuronal substrates in order to       
identify and characterize components of drug action that might be relevant      
to potential for abuse and to related phenomena, such as tolerance and          
physical dependence. Representative compounds will be studied over a range      
of doses in several complementary behavioral procedures, such as drug           
discrimination, locomotor activity, autotitration of reinforcement              
threshold for electrical stimulation of the brain, and drug-induced             
turning. Established collaborations with faculty colleagues will bring          
additional methodologies to bear on the research questions of interest.         
Most experiments will be performed on rats, some on squirrel monkeys.           
This approach will help in the interpretation of experimental findings by       
indicating their generality with respect to pharmacological, behavioral,        
and species variables.                                                          
                                                                                
The proposed experiments will address several hypotheses. Among them are:       
1)Brain opioid systems can, under some conditions, modulate brain dopamine      
systems and behavioral effects of drugs that are mediated by dopamine. 2)       
Single-dose opioid agonist-induced sensitization to effects of antagonists      
is a model of acute physical dependence. 3) Discriminative effects of low       
and high doses of caffeine model, respectively, positive and negative mood      
states induced by caffeine in humans. 4) Brain dopamine systems mediate         
some behavioral effects of caffeine and tolerance to those effects,             
sometimes as a result of adenosine-receptor blockade.                           
                                                                                
Several pre- and postdoctral trainees will participate in this research         
program each year. An important goal will be to provide them with               
technical and, most important, intellectual skills necessary for careers        
in research on the behavioral pharmacology of drugs of abuse.

that contribute to the onset of obesity and its complications, notably          
NIDDM. These mechanisms include: l.  control of expression of the obese         
(leptin) gene in the adipocyte, and 2. transcriptional control of the           
stearoylCoA desaturase genes (SCD1 and SCD2) in the adipocyte and

Leptin, a secretory protein expressed only by adipose tissue, regulates         
appetite (via receptors in the hypothalamus) and energy metabolism.  The        
3T3-L1 adipocyte system, pioneered in this laboratory, will be used as a        
cell culture model that mimics adipocytes in vivo. Our studies show that        
leptin is expressed/secreted by 3T3-L1 adipocytes and its expression is         
dramatically regulated in vivo by changes in physiological state. We have       
cloned/sequenced the regulatory 5' flanking region of the gene for use in       
the studies proposed. We plan to:

The SCD genes catalyze delta9 cis-desaturation of fatty acids, and thereby      
determine the degree of unsaturation and functional properties of membrane      
phospholipids and storage/secretory triacylglycerols). Expression of the        
SCD1 and SCD2 genes is induced during adipocyte differentiation and is          
feed-back inhibited by polyunsaturated fatty acids (notably arachidonate)       
in certain cell types. We have cloned, sequenced and characterized the          
mouse SCD1 and SCD2 genes.  A preadipocyte -repressive element (or PRE)         
and its binding protein (PRE-BP1) was discovered that maintains the SCD2        
gene in the repressed state prior to differentiation. A similar, but            
distinct, element and binding protein have been identified for the SCD1         
gene. We plan to:

that affect every tissue and organ of the tadpole.  The process is              
controlled entirely by thyroid hormone (TH).  The goal of this project is       
to understand at a molecular level how one hormone can initiate so many         
different developmental programs and to elucidate the molecular details of      
a few of these programs.  The experimental strategy has three phases:           
first, the isolation of up and down regulated gene in several programs,         
second, the identification of regulated genes by sequencing and comparison      
with the public data base, and third, the determination of the role of          
these genes in the developmental program.  During the past 5 years we have      
completed the first two phases, and in this proposal we outline functional      
assays for the many genes that we have identified.  In the course of these      
experiments it has become apparent that amphibian metamorphosis is a            
superb model system for the study of TH action at the molecular level.          
These studies will provide information relevant to the various questions        
addressed by researchers who have used exclusively mammals and chickens as      
their experimental organisms.  The hormone receptors are the same, and the      
general pattern of their expression is similar.  The well known negative        
feedback loop between the thyroid and pituitary glands in mammals actually      
develops during metamorphosis.  The amphibian system is far easier to           
manipulate than chickens and mammals as will become evident from the body       
of this application.  Because of the accessibility of the system and our        
development of a powerful subtractive hybridization method (the ""gene           
expression screen""), large numbers of TH regulated genes have been              
identified in tadpoles far in excess of all the TH regulated genes              
combined that have been found in other organisms.  This prompts a               
reexamination of the thyroid response elements (TRE) and some classic           
questions about the molecular basis of TH action.  In addition, TH induced      
metamorphosis provides a novel way to study vertebrate organogenesis since      
the characteristic organ changes can be induced at will by the                  
experimenter simply by adding exogenous hormone to a competent tadpole.         
In Th-induced metamorphosis the expression of a predetermined program is        
studied.  However, we are now analyzing two related complex developmental       
systems designed to find genes that set up the programs.  These two             
systems are tail regeneration and the homeotic transformation from tail to      
limb induced by retinoic acid.  These systems are examples of important         
biological events controlled by changes in gene expression that are not         
subject to genetic analysis but can be studied by this three phase              
approach.  The affect of any hormone on its target tissue, the action of        
drugs that work by affecting gene expression, and the comparison of genes       
expressed in a variety of diseased versus normal tissues are candidates         
for this kind of analysis.

enzymes with substrate analogues, allosteric effectors, inhibitors, and         
other molecules and ions, including mutants and other modified forms of         
the enzymes.  The allosteric enzymes under study are fructose-1, 6-

chorismate mutase (CMase) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  We will also          
continue studies of the non-allosteric enzyme leucine aminopeptidase (LAP

transmission of conformational information from the allosteric sites to         
the active sites.  Although many such studies have been completed for

FBPase, an enzyme which is elevated in Type II diabetes; the method             
consisted of repeated consecutive cycles of structures of FBPase bound to       
the inhibitor followed by model building of a newly designed inhibitor          
from the X-ray results, followed by chemical synthesis.  Active site

transcriptional regulation. One major project area focusses on the              
mechanism for coupling the expression of certain viral genes to DNA             
replication during the development of the bacterial virus T4, a process         
that is now known to involve transcriptional enhancer mechanisms. The           
principal research topics are: 1) the role of DNA connectivity in the           
enhancement (i.e. whether enhancing interactions occur in a                     
three-dimensional space or whether they require tracking along DNA); 2) the     
effects of assembling replication proteins into replisome on their ability      
to enhance transcription and the effects of ongoing replication on              
enhancement; 3) figuring out how transcriptional enhancement works at the       
molecular level by mapping protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions at      
the promoter and at the enhancer. These four broad topics will be pursued       
by various in vitro methods, including transcription kinetics, various          
footprinting techniques, photocrosslinking of protein to DNA, other             
crosslinking methods and other methods of analyzing the binding of proteins     
to DNA in assemblies of moderate complexity. A fourth topic involves            
certain in vivo correlates of the preceding analysis.                           
                                                                                
The second project area consists of several research topics involving           
transcription by RNA polymerase III. It is now clear that only one              
transcription factor of the yeast RNA polymerase III, TFIIIB, is essential      
for positioning the enzyme at the start site for transcription. One             
research topic analyzes this minimal transcription initiation system in         
kinetic and structural terms, using normal and mutant promoters. A second       
research topic involves the use of photochemical methods, including the use     
of a newly developed photocrosslinking reagent, to analyze the structure of     
transcription complexes and to map protein-protein as well as protein-DNA       
interactions along an entire transcription unit. A third research topic         
involves kinetic and structural analysis of RNA chain elongation and            
termination by RNA polymerase III.                                              
                                                                                
The connecting thread of these two lines of research is their common focus      
on a molecular understanding of transcription and its regulation and on         
processes such as promoter finding, promoter opening, modulations of            
promoter strength by protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, RNA          
chain elongation and termination that are common to transcription in all        
organisms and all types of cells.

define the centrosphere; an organizing center for microtubules.  In cells
bearing cilia or flagella they form the proximal region of the basal body,
a nucleating structure for microtubules of the flagellar axonemes.  It is
proposed to study the function and replication of centrioles/basal bodies
in the model system Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  In this organism a number
of mutants affecting basal body function and assembly are clustered on an
unusual linkage group that has Mendelian segregation patterns but gives a
circular linkage map.  The physical counterpart of this linkage group is a
6-9 megabase linear DNA that has been localized to basal bodies.  In its
mitotic and meiotic cycle Chlamydomonas manifests the classical motifs to
centriolar morphogenesis:  replicative formation, de novo origin and
interconversion to basal bodies.  The proposed studies focus on the basal
body associated DNA.  It is proposed to study further the structure of this
DNA to understand the origin of the circular genetic map and to determine
its localization in the cell at times in the meiotic cycle when
centriole/basal bodies are absent.  A major effort will be made to clone
and characterize unique sequence segments of this DNA corresponding to a
limited region of the genetic map.  The proposed studies are strongly
supported by features of the model system.  Lineages derived from
interspecific crosses with C. smithii make restriction fragment length
polymorphism linkage mapping efficient.  The basal body associated DNA can
be isolated as a chromosome by pulsed field gel electrophoresis thus
providing an enriched source of DNA fragments.  The linkage group segment
to be analyzed has already been indexed by ten phenotypic markers and six
molecular markers.  Methods have been devised to synchronize events in the
meiotic and mitotic life cycles for isolation of RNAs.  The proposed
transcription analysis, testing of homology to DNAs from other cells, and
DNA sequence analysis are expected to reveal the function of this DNA and
indicate whether it is a feature of other centriole/basal body containing

lead to rearrangement of the enteric bacterial chromosome.  Chromosomal
rearrangements are of importance because they allow types of genetic
variation that cannot be obtained by other routes.  Rearrangements may take
the form of duplications, deletions, transpositions or inversions.  Our
efforts will be focused on those structures within the chromosome which are
prone to participating in rearrangements, on the consequences to cell
fitness of these rearrangements and on the pressures which may exist for
conserving the gross gene organization of the chromosome.

Earlier studies of missense suppression in Escherichia coli demonstrated
that certain aspects of the genetics of missense suppressors had their
basis in chromosomal rearrangement.  In one instance, suppressor
instability was related to the fact that the suppressor gene was in a
tandem duplication, which allowed both the suppressor and its essential
wild type allele to coexist.  The duplications were produced by crossover
between different rRNA operons, seven of which occur in the enteric
bacterial chromosome.  These redundant rrn operons are ""hot spots"" for not
only duplications, but also deletions, inversions and transpositions.  In a
second instance, the strength of a missense suppressor was enhanced through
the amplification of the gene for glycyl-tRNA synthetase.  This
amplification involved unequal crossover between two members of a complex
family of imperfectly homologous genes called the rhs family.  This project
focuses on these two types of natural ""hot spots"" for rearrangement, the
rrn family and the rhs family.  Highest priority is to be devoted to the
rhs loci.  They are to be analyzed as to their structure, function, map
position, origins and the degree to which they participate in and are
altered by recombinational processes.  Another area of high priority is an
extension of our analysis of unequal recombination between the redundant
rrn operons.  The consequences of unequal crossover between rrn operons,
the factors which mitigate against the establishment or rrn mediated
rearrangements in evolution, and ""gene conversion"" events between rrn
operons with limited sequence differences will be studied.  A third area of
interest is the nature of chromosomal rearrangements that are prevalent in
E. coli by S. typhimunrium crosses.

as a model system in which to define general principles underlying cell
organelle formation.  When the flagella are detached, transcription of
genes for flagellar proteins is rapidly induced followed by translation of
mRNAs for flagellar proteins and, within minutes, assembly of a new
flagellum begins.  We will investigate these processes studying,
specifically, the synthesis and assembly of the flagellar radial spoke
proteins.  The spokes are attached to the A-tubules of the flagellar outer
doublet microtubules, have a head and stalk which are composed of 17
polypeptides, and are required for motility.  There are paralyzed mutants
in several of these polypeptides and the genes for 5 have been cloned.
Transformation can be used to rescue the paralyzed mutants back to
motility.  In vitro mutagenesis and transformation will be used to
determine the radial spoke gene sequences responsible for (a) gene up-
regulation following flagellar detachment, (b) targeting of radial spoke
proteins to the flagellum, and (c) assembly of the proteins onto the outer
doublet microtubules.  Phosphorylation of radial spoke proteins is
necessary for assembly of functional radial spokes.  By use of mutants
lacking a flagellar protein kinase, as well as in vitro mutagenesis and
transformation, the role of radial spoke protein phosphorylation in either
the targeting of proteins to the flagellum or their assembly onto the
axoneme will be determined.  Extracts from wild-type and radial spoke
mutant cells will be used to assemble radial spokes onto spokeless axonemes
in vitro.  Assembly will be determined by electron microscopy, gold-labeled
antibody localization, and sedimentation of labeled spoke proteins with the
doublet microtubules.  These studies will help determine the order of
assembly of radial spoke proteins, in a manner similar to that used to
analyze T-4 phage morphogenesis.  To determine how the flagellar proteins
find their way to the end of the cell where flagellar assembly occurs, the
site of radial spoke protein synthesis in the cytoplasm will be
investigated on the ultrastructural level using gold-labeled antibodies and
in situ RNA hybridization.

Almost all of the flagellar alpha-tubulin is acetylated and the hypothesis
that acetylation plays a role in the attachment of microtubule-associated
proteins/structures to the microtubules will be tested by use of acetylated
and unacetylated microtubules in an in vitro assembly system with
microtubule-associated proteins/structures.  Assembly will be analyzed by

thrombin formation, particularly upon control of the activation of Hageman
factor (factor XII).  Our immediate goal is to elucidate the role of
inhibitors of the activation of this clotting factor that are derived from
vascular endothelial cells.  We will also explore the importance of

1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), a key regulatory enzyme in gluconeogenesis,
functions as a catalyst and is controlled at the molecular level.
Experiments are to be conducted with the enzyme from mammalian brain and
liver tissue.

Although brain is not a gluconeogenic tissue, it does contain FBPase.
Because the substrate for this enzyme is the product of a key step in brain
glycolysis involving the enzyme phosphofructokinase, coordinated regulation
of these two enzymes is essential to brain tissue viability.  Brain FBPase
is somewhat unique among mammalian FBPases for two reasons:  it does not
require exogenous metal ion for activity, and it is not inhibited by AMP.
One of the aims of this application is to investigate the regulation of the
brain enzyme as well as its mechanism of action.

The role of exogenous metal ion in FBPase enzymology is not clearly
understood.  Attempts will be made to evaluate the role of exogenous metal
in catalysis and regulation from kinetic experiments in the
nonphysiological direction in the presence and absence of AMP.

Liver FBPase has two or three tightly associated metal ions per monomeric
subunit.  The enzyme itself is a tetramer.  The function of these metals
will be investigated using a variety of techniques, including nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  The metals may facilitate catalysis by
binding to the oxygen atoms at the 1-phosphate position of the substrate,
thereby aiding nucleophilic attack by a hydroxyl ion on the phosphorous
atom.  On the other hand, they may simply tether the substrate to the
enzyme by hydrogen bonding a liganded water molecule to the substrate, or
they may merely provide the enzyme with the proper conformation for
catalysis.  Answers to these questions may be provided by replacing the
natural metal Zn2+, with the paramagnetic ion Mn2+.  By taking advantage of
the fact that paramagnetic ions can effectively relax diamagnetic nuclei,
and that this effect is distance dependent, it is possible to measure the
distance from the metal binding site to a particular nucleus, such as the
1-P of the substrate.  A knowledge of these distances may provide insights
into the role of the metals in catalysis.  It is also possible using this
technique to obtain information on how physiologically important
regulators, such as AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatate, function at the
molecular level to inhibit FBPase.

intracellular mechanisms for regulation of synthesis of ACE by bovine

regulation of ACE synthesis in bovine and human endothelial cells and will
also extend these studies to macrophages, monocytes and fibroblasts.  The
mechanism by which hypoxia elevates cellular ACE will be evaluated.  A
factor we have found to be produced by smooth muscle cells that stimulates
ACE synthesis by endothelial cells will be studied.  In addition to Ca2+

will be explored and possible intermediate effects on protein
phosphorylations through kinase actions will be examined.  We will continue
to assess ACE by enzymatic activity, but will also utilize our newly
developed ELISA for measuring ACE antigen in cells and radiolabeling with
[35S] methionine for turnover studies that should better define kinetics of
our observations.  Synthetic cDNA probes will be developed by polymerase
chain reaction for measurement of ACE mRNA in human and bovine cells and
tissue.  This methodology will be applied to assessments of the role of
transcriptional processes for various factors that influence cellular ACE.

fundamental questions in contemporary biology.  We propose to address these
questions by investigation of two highly regulated enzymes of carbohydrate
metabolism, human brain hexokinase (HKI) and porcine liver fructose-1, 6-
bisphosphatase (FBPase).  HKI is believed to be the pacemaker of glycolysis
in brain tissue, whereas FBPase is a crucial control step in
gluconeogenesis.  Thus these enzymes are related in the sense that one is
involved in glucose utilization, whereas the other is critical to the
synthesis of blood glucose.

Brain which only comprises 2-3% of total mammalian body weight utilizes
approximately 25% of the circulating blood glucose and about 20% of the
oxygen consumed by the body.  In cerebral tissue, under normal
physiological conditions, glucose phosphorylation is mediated by HKI, and
it is then metabolized via the Krebs cycle to synthesize ATP which is
required in large quantities for brain metabolism.  Human HKI was recently
cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli in our laboratory.  In order to
gain insights into the putative glucose and ATP binding domains, the
regulatory sites, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence responsible for
HKI binding to the mitochondrial pore structure, studies involving site-
specific mutagenesis will be undertaken.  NMR spectroscopy will be used in
conjunction with the mutagenesis experiments to investigate the mechanism
of the HKI reaction, its molecular mechanism of regulation, and structure-
function relationships of the enzyme.

The 3-dimensional structure of FBPase is currently available.  Analysis of
this model can be used to evaluate the structure-function relationships
that exist at the active and allosteric sites of this enzyme from site-
specific mutagenesis studies.  We will clone and express the pig kidney
FBPase gene in E. coli as a prerequisite to doing the site-directed

to characterize the enzymes of the acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate (acyl

precursors, phosphatidic acid and its ether analog.  Several recent
discoveries, such as the presence of acyl DHAP pathway enzymes in
microbodies (peroxisomes and microperoxisomes), the identification of a
number of congenital peroxisomal disorders which result in a deficiency
of tissue ether lipids, and the recognition of biomessenger and second
messenger roles for ether lipids, have emphasized the importance of the
acyl DHAP pathway enzymes in membrane lipid biogenesis.  Two of these
enzymes, DHAP acyltransferase and alkyl DHAP synthase, are deficient in
a number of genetic diseases involving peroxisomal disorders, such as
Zellweger cerebrohepatorenal syndrome (ZS), Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia
punctata (RCDP), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease,
etc.  Individuals with these diseases suffer from progressive
neurological disorders and mental retardation, and are diagnosed by the
deficiency of their cellular DHAP acyltransferase.  In this application
we intend to make thorough studies of the molecular properties and
cellular regulation of two of these acyl DHAP pathway enzymes.  The
following specific aims are proposed:

  1) To purify the key membrane-bound enzyme, DHAP acyltransferase
(DHAPAT), to homogeneity.  Following purification, the properties,
catalytic reaction mechanisms, and regulation of its activity by membrane
lipids will be investigated.  2) To generate specific antibodies against
DHAPAT and acyl/alkyl DHAP reductase (which has already been purified to
homogeneity), which will be used to study the tissue distribution and
subcellular localization of the enzymes, the developmental profile of the
enzymes in brain, and to detect the presence of mutant enzymes in
peroxisomal genetic diseases, such as ZS and RCDP. 3) To study the
molecular properties, regulation and biogenesis of acyl/alkyl DHAP
reductase by determining its primary structure by cloning and sequencing
the corresponding cDNA.

The results obtained from these studies will not only enhance our

our understanding of the molecular basis of heredity.  More
significantly, the emergence of a new molecular paradigm -
reverse genetics, which relies on the ability to specifically modify
the structure of genes in vitro and to test their biological
properties, has revolutionized the experimental approaches in
molecular genetics.  The ability to construct minichromosomes
with novel arrangements of genetic elements also provides
vectors for the isolation of genes as well as substrates for the
analysis of specific genetic reactions.  Our proposal, which applies
this approach to explore the basic mechanisms of gene regulation
in the establishment of immune responsiveness and of genetic
recombination, aims

(1)  identify the factors and mechanisms that limit the
epression of antibody genes to only lymphoid cells;
(2)  isolate and characterize the human gene whose
dysfunction is responsible for galactosemia;
(3)  understand the mechanisms responsible for non-
homologous, homologous and non-reciprocal modes of
genetic recombination, especially those which permit the
rejoining of broken DNA;
(4)  develop genetic approaches to effect a replacement or
repair of chromosomal DNA sequences;
(5)  developing vectors which can deliver genes to only
specific types of cells.

It is anticipated that the information we develop will advance our
unerstanding of the molecular basis of disease and provide novel
approaches to their prevention, treatment and cure.

study how volume-activated transport systems are coordinated, and to study
how volume is regulated in vivo. Red cells are selected for study because
of their anatomical simplicity. The experiments involve measurements of
water, ions, and metabolic intermediates in red cells plus radioisotopic
labeling and separation of red cell membrane proteins. The in vivo work
entails the administration of an antimetabolite, hydroxyurea, to
experimental animals. The red cells of human subjects who are being treated

clinical importance of this work is that changes in cell water content are
a common and potentially lethal manifestation of many disease states,

the world, and which has many of the characteristics of a drug of abuse.

The basic strategy of this research program is to use behavioral
methodologies to study interactions of drugs with their neuronal
substrates.  The objective is to identify and characterize components of
drug action that may be relevant to potential for abuse and to related
phenomena, such as tolerance and physical dependence.  The neuronal
substrates of drug action will be characterized with receptor-selective

compounds will be studied over a range of doses in several behavioral
procedures, such as drug discrimination, food-reinforced operant

on rats and, often, on squirrel monkeys.  This approach will help in
assessing the generality  of experimental findings with respect to
pharmacological, behavioral, and species variables.

The proposed experiments will address a number of hypotheses.  Among these
are:  1) Endogenous opioid peptides can modulate the behavioral effects of
exogenously administered opioid drugs; 2) Similar components of drug action
mediate discriminative stimulus, reinforcing stimulus, and subjective drug
effects; 3) The discriminative stimulus effects of low and high doses of

shown to play a role in the biosynthesis of glycerolipids, especially the
containing ether linkages (glycerol-ether lipids and plasmalogens).  In
recent years, a number of discoveries such as the presence of acyl DHAP

raise specific antibodies against these enzymes and then to use these

around two isozymes, brain and muscle hexokinase.  The activity of the

magnetic resonance procedures.  In addition, we expect to investigate the
kinetic mechanism of action of the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis
of the inhibitor, fructose-6-P 2 kinase, and finally, we propose to study

The hypothesis states that red blood cells in all these conditions are
subject to fragmentation or budding.  The vesicles that bud off the cells
are believed to be richer in water and salts and poorer in hemoglobin
content than the parent cells, thus leaving the latter dense, viscous, and
poorly deformable.  The work proposed here involves a one year feasibility

definitive muscle, cartilage, or pigment cell may produce neoplastic cells
when they malfunction has been discussed since Boveri's time over 60 years
ago.  To this end, the impact of TPA, EMS, pp60 v-src, and BrUdR on the
differentiation programs of primary cultured myogenic, chondrogenic, and
melanogenic cells is studied.  These 4 pleiotropic molecules, each having a
different initial intracellular target, share one remarkable property -
they selectively, but reversibly block transcription of that subset of
genes which define the treated cell's differentiation program.  These
conclusions derive from following (a) the synthesis of cell-specific
proteins, and (b) the accumulation of these cell-specific mRNAs in the
treated cells.  The vulnerability of a normal cell's differentiation
program to these agents cannot be ascribed to a generalized cytotoxicity
reaction, but may be analogous to the transcriptional response of
heat-shocked cells.  The semi-autonomy of a cell's differentiation program
in the context of the regulation of ""household"" molecules is striking.
These experiments also provide unusually favorable models for the study of
normal myofibrillogenesis and chondrogenesis, as well as the role of
c-oncogenes in the regulation of proliferation and/or cell diversification.

Our common model for normal cell diversification and transformation
postulates that the lineage-dependent activation of cell-specific subsets
of genes active in early compartments of a given lineage, are inactive in
later compartments.  To test this, 0-16 hour chick blastodisc cells were
dissociated and cultured at low density.  They demonstrate that hours prior
to gastrulation, and well before putative ""cell-cell,
epithelial-mesenchymal inductive interactions"", blastodisc cells have been
channeled into different, transitory, founder cells for multi-, bi-, and
unipotential lineages.  These findings suggest that early and late stages
of diversification reflect genetically pre-programmed intracellular
changes, rather than changes primarily induced by exogenous molecules.
These conclusions are also consistent with the proposition that the unique
phenotypic properties of any given type of transformed cell must be
pre-determined by the differentiation program of its normal progenitor cell.

related to the genus Mycobacteria continue to plague largeareas of the
world.  The long-range objective of this research program is to contribute
to our understanding of the fundamental physiology of mycobacteria with the
belief that this understanding can lead to improved procedures for treating
and controlling tuberculosis and leprosy.  The core of the program is
centered on the fact that mycobacteria have an unusual lipid metabolism,
which enhances their pathogenicity by providing an impervious cell wall
that is resistant to macrophage attack, and which lipid metabolism is
facilitated by the novel ability of mycobacteria to synthesize and use
complex carbohydrates as lipid carriers.  The specific carbohydrates are
called polymethylpolysaccharides and were discovered and characterized in
the laboratory of the applicant.  The polymethylpolysaccharides, composed
of a 3-0-methylmannose polysaccharide and a 6-0-methylglucose
lipopolysaccharide, act as lipid carriers by coiling up around the extended
fatty acid chain and forming a water-soluble 1:1 complex with the included
lipid.  This unusual interaction is due to the inherently hydrophobic
nature of the interior of a coiled Alpha 1 greater than 4-glycan, but it is
also enhanced by the increase in nonpolar character provided by the methyl
ehter groups.  The immediate aims of this proposal are (1) to delineate the
pathways for biosynthesis and degradation of the 6-0-methylglucose
lipopolysaccharide, (2) to define in more detail the nature of the
complexation between polymethylpolysaccharide and lipid, (3) to explore
approaches to the chemical synthesis of analogs of the
polymethylpolysaccharides that may have useful lipid-binding properties,
and (4) to investigate the structure, biosynthesis and immunochemistry of a
new mycobacterial glycolipid.  Part 1 of this proposal will deal with the
incorporation of radiolabeled compounds into precursor intermediates of the
polysaccharide and with the characterization of products of enzymic
degradation of the intact methylglucose polysaccharide; part 2 will involve
studies of polysaccharide-lipid complex formation by fast atom bombardment
mass spectrometry, by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, and by X-ray
crystallography; part 3 is concerned with chemical modification of amylose
to yield oligosaccharides with lipid-binding properties; and part 4 will
make use of classical methods of carbohydrate characterization and
immunochemistry.

These studies will allow comparisons between cellular, organ and

ACE in cell culture and in vivo will be studied by immunoprecipitation
techniques, utilizing antibody prepared against purified ACE.  Factors
regulating the synthesis, degradation and release of ACE will be evaluated
in cell culture with initial emphasis placed on hormonal regulation, the
role of the sugar moiety and possible feedback inhibition by product
formation.  Similar assessments of regulation will be done in vivo with a
rat model.  Since it is recognized that ACE activity is elevated in sera of
patients with sarcoidosis, possible unique properties of ACE in sera of
patients with sarcoidosis will be evaluated by isoelectric focusing and
immunoblotting, and the ELISA method we have developed will be used to
compare absolute quantity of enzyme with serum enzymatic activity in these
patients.  Measurement and characterization of ACE and factors regulating
its synthesis and release will be studied in peripheral blood monocytes and
alveolar macrophages of patients with sarcoidosis.  With these studies we
hope to gain a broader understanding of structural properties of human ACE

the synthesis, release and general metabolism of ACE; and to determine the
utility of new approaches to studies of this enzyme in sarcoidosis.

infections) and/or abnormal signaling (e.g. polycystic kidney disease, blindness). Such ciliopathies can
result from improper assembly of cilia; therefore, understanding how ciliary precursors are brought to the
cilium and into the ciliary compartment may shed new light on their role in disease. How essential
structural components are delivered from their site of synthesis to the ciliary axoneme, is a mystery. To
address this issue a novel preparation of vesicles has been isolated during flagellar assembly from the
cytoplasm of Chlamydomonas, a pivotal organism for the study of assembly and function of cilia. These
vesicles carry ciliary membrane proteins (e.g. CrPKD2) as well as components of the ciliary axoneme,
including tubulin and radial spoke proteins. Combining high resolution imaging, proteomics and RNAi
knockdown, the hypothesis that axonemal proteins are transported to the cilium via peripheral
attachment to vesicles targeted to the periciliary membrane is being tested. Once at the base of the
cilium, the flagellar transition zone (TZ) is involved in determining which proteins enter/exit the flagellar
compartment. Many proteins involved in ciliopathies are found in the TZ. To further characterize the
composition of the TZ, TZs of Chlamydomonas have been isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry.
Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) proteins, which are involved in membrane
dynamics, were identified in this analysis, heralding a previously unknown function of the TZ, which will be
studied. These proteins may be involved in removing ubiquitinated proteins from the cilium, the release of
ciliary membrane into the surrounding milieu, or in the severing of the organelle from the cell - three poorly
understood processes known to occur in cilia. Additional newly identified proteins of the TZ that are

disease.",Synthesis and Assembly of Flagellar Proteins,"A major resurgence in research on cilia and flagella (synonymous terms) occurred following the discovery of

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ABSTRACT:  The long-term goal of this grant proposal is to understand at an atomic level how the ribosome functions during protein synthesis. We will take a multidisciplinary approach utilizing genetic, biochemical and structural methods to study the bacterial ribosome. Our first aim is to examine ribosome structural dynamics during decoding of mRNA and its inhibition by antibiotics. We will use X-ray crystallography to obtain high-resolution structures of mutant Thermus thermophilus 30S subunits that reveal new conformational states. We will examine the effects of the mutations on the accuracy and kinetics of decoding. Our second aim is to probe a pathway by which codon recognition is signaled via ribosomal protein S12 and aminoacyl-tRNA to EF-Tu to activate GTP hydrolysis, a key step in the tRNA selection process. These experiments are designed to provide fundamental insights into ribosome structure and function, including new conformational states of the ribosome, to aid in understanding the decoding process. The ability to solve structures of ribosomes with antibiotic-resistance mutations will aid in understanding the mechanisms of antibiotic action and resistance, and has particular clinical relevance for the rational design of drugs to fight resistant microbial pathogens.

Protein synthesis in bacteria is the target of over half of all antibiotics, and modifications and mutations in components involved of this process can lead to antibiotic resistance, one of the most pressing medical problems of our time. Deciphering the molecular basis for antibiotic resistance will provide important information needed for the rational design of novel antimicrobial agents effective against antibiotic resistant microorganisms. A more comprehensive examination of the structural basis for protein synthesis will also provide important insights into one of the most fundamental processes found in all forms of life.

replication during the development of the bacterial virus T4, a process

rapid anterograde and retrograde movement of particles between the

Likewise, mutations in the microtubule motors that power anterograde and

These changes are controlled by thyroid hormone (TH). Metamorphosis is a remarkably tractable developmental system since the diverse changes can be induced precociously with exogenous TH or inhibited pharmacologically with well known ""goitrogens"" added to the rearing water. Many features of TH physiology are the same in all vertebrates including the negative feedback loop between the thyroid gland the pituitary, the remarkable similarity in the TH receptors (TR), their RCR partners, and the DNA elements (TRE) to which these receptors bind. We have developed a three phase strategy to study individual programs of metamorphosis. First, we identified genes that are up- and down-regulated by TH in the tail, limb, intestine, and a cultured cell by means of a subtractive hybridization method that has the added power of estimating the number of genes in each program. We have concentrated our attention on the simplest program, tail resorption, in which we isolated about half of the TH-induced up- and down-regulated genes (17 and 4, respectively) clues about their possible roles in the resorption program. This grant application deals with the third phase which is underway, namely assaying genes for functional role in metamorphosis. The recent discovery of a transgenesis method for Xenopus laevis has provided us with such an assay. The function of the TH response gene in metamorphoses can be assessed as well as the various receptors, co-activators, and o-repressors that are presumed to play a role in the ability of TH to alter gene expression. Of special interest is an examination of the role of unliganded thyroid receptor in suppressing metamorphic changes. The participation of various hormones other than TH that have been implicated in amphibian metamorphosis is being assessed. The molecular explanation for many well documented biological features of metamorphosis such as the onset of competence to respond to TH, the different chronology of tissue response to the hormone (heterochrony) can be studied from a new perspective. We have already observed instructive phenotypes by over-expressing genes that inhibit metamorphosis. Strategies are described that can take advantage of these phenotypes and elucidate developmental pathways. ",AMPHIBIAN METAMORPHOSIS--A DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAM,,DONALD D BROWN,1898460

developmental biology concerns the specification of identities along linear     
axes.  Axial development frequently involves serial structures, as for          
example somites, which develop differentially depending on their position.      
Seemingly diverse developmental processes such as the formation of the          
cranial nerves, vertebrae, limbs, and the urogenital system all share the       
feature of axial specification that may involve common underlying               
developmental mechanisms.  There is growing support for this integrative        
concept based primarily on the discovery of the homeobox genes which are        
highly conserved throughout multicellular organisms and involved in axial       
specification.  The Principal Investigator will examine the molecular basis     
of homeobox gene activation associated with the specification of                
developmental identity.  Hoxc-8 was chosen because it is representative of      
the medial class of Hox genes and because a wealth of information exists for    
this gene.  Three major approaches to the analysis of Hoxc-8, all of which      
involve different aspects of its transcriptional control, will be taken.        
The first will identify enhancer motifs using reporter constructs in            
transgenic mice.  Experience has shown this approach to be reliable,            
efficient, and rapid.  The transgenic system will be combined with the use      
of YACs containing the mouse Hoxc cluster, and a novel clasper vector that      
permits the precise dissection of YACs by recombination.  These new tools       
facilitate the detection of enhancer elements operating at substantial          
distances from the promoter, enhancer sharing between Hox genes, and genetic    
complementation.  The second will characterize transcription factors            
regulating the expression of Hox genes by interaction with the defined          
enhancer motifs.  Attention will be given to the combinational interaction      
of these proteins, a possibility underlined by their preliminary findings.      
The third will investigate functional aspects of Hoxc-8 enhancers at the        
molecular level using in vivo ligation-mediated PCR footprinting, using         
embryonic tissues, transgenic mice, and transformed cell populations.

 program of research is proposed for studying behavioral effects of two
 types of drugs of significant clinical, social, and theoretical
 importance: 1) opioids, some of which have long represented a serious
 abuse problem; 2) caffeine, the most widely consumed behaviorally-active
 drug in the world, which has features that make it a convenient model
 ""drug of abuse"". The proposed experiments will be supported by two
 research grants from NIDA.
 
 The basic research strategy is to use behavioral methodologies as
 bioassays of drug interactions with their neuronal substrates in order to
 identify and characterize components of drug action that might be relevant
 to potential for abuse and to related phenomena, such as tolerance and
 physical dependence. Representative compounds will be studied over a range
 of doses in several complementary behavioral procedures, such as drug
 discrimination, locomotor activity, autotitration of reinforcement
 threshold for electrical stimulation of the brain, and drug-induced
 turning. Established collaborations with faculty colleagues will bring
 additional methodologies to bear on the research questions of interest.
 Most experiments will be performed on rats, some on squirrel monkeys.
 This approach will help in the interpretation of experimental findings by
 indicating their generality with respect to pharmacological, behavioral,
 and species variables.
 
 The proposed experiments will address several hypotheses. Among them are:
 1)Brain opioid systems can, under some conditions, modulate brain dopamine
 systems and behavioral effects of drugs that are mediated by dopamine. 2)
 Single-dose opioid agonist-induced sensitization to effects of antagonists
 is a model of acute physical dependence. 3) Discriminative effects of low
 and high doses of caffeine model, respectively, positive and negative mood
 states induced by caffeine in humans. 4) Brain dopamine systems mediate
 some behavioral effects of caffeine and tolerance to those effects,
 sometimes as a result of adenosine-receptor blockade.
 
 Several pre- and postdoctral trainees will participate in this research
 program each year. An important goal will be to provide them with
 technical and, most important, intellectual skills necessary for careers
 in research on the behavioral pharmacology of drugs of abuse.

 transcriptional regulation. One major project area focusses on the
 mechanism for coupling the expression of certain viral genes to DNA
 replication during the development of the bacterial virus T4, a process
 that is now known to involve transcriptional enhancer mechanisms. The
 principal research topics are: 1) the role of DNA connectivity in the
 enhancement (i.e. whether enhancing interactions occur in a
 three-dimensional space or whether they require tracking along DNA); 2) the
 effects of assembling replication proteins into replisome on their ability
 to enhance transcription and the effects of ongoing replication on
 enhancement; 3) figuring out how transcriptional enhancement works at the
 molecular level by mapping protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions at
 the promoter and at the enhancer. These four broad topics will be pursued
 by various in vitro methods, including transcription kinetics, various
 footprinting techniques, photocrosslinking of protein to DNA, other
 crosslinking methods and other methods of analyzing the binding of proteins
 to DNA in assemblies of moderate complexity. A fourth topic involves
 certain in vivo correlates of the preceding analysis.
 
 The second project area consists of several research topics involving
 transcription by RNA polymerase III. It is now clear that only one
 transcription factor of the yeast RNA polymerase III, TFIIIB, is essential
 for positioning the enzyme at the start site for transcription. One
 research topic analyzes this minimal transcription initiation system in
 kinetic and structural terms, using normal and mutant promoters. A second
 research topic involves the use of photochemical methods, including the use
 of a newly developed photocrosslinking reagent, to analyze the structure of
 transcription complexes and to map protein-protein as well as protein-DNA
 interactions along an entire transcription unit. A third research topic
 involves kinetic and structural analysis of RNA chain elongation and
 termination by RNA polymerase III.
 
 The connecting thread of these two lines of research is their common focus
 on a molecular understanding of transcription and its regulation and on
 processes such as promoter finding, promoter opening, modulations of
 promoter strength by protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, RNA
 chain elongation and termination that are common to transcription in all

 immediate and coordinate upregulation of over 150 genes encoding flagellar
 proteins.  Synthesis of flagellar proteins rapidly ensues and, within
 minutes, new flagellar assembly is initiated.  To understand the process of
 organelle assembly we will study the synthesis and assembly of the
 flagellar radical spokes.  These structures, found only in the flagella,
 are required for flagellar motility; they are attached to the A-tubules of
 the outer doublet microtubules and are composed of 17 radial spoke
 polypeptides (RSPs) assembled into separable head and stalk domains.  We
 have cloned and sequenced the genes for several of these polypeptides,
 successfully using them to rescue mutants defective in spoke assembly.
 
 Chlamydomonas is a polarized cell with the flagella at one end.  With RSP
 antibodies and RSP cDNAs, we will determine by immunoelectron microscopy
 and in situ hybridization the site of RSP synthesis in the cytoplasm and
 subsequent route to the flagella.  We will also determine if the 17 RSPs
 form cytoplasmic pre-assembly aggregates prior to their transport to the
 flagellum.  To examine the assembly of spoke proteins onto the axoneme,
 RSPs obtained from cytoplasmic and flagellar extracts will be assembled
 onto axonemes isolated from mutants lacking entire spokes or spoke heads.
 We will continue to characterize the axonemal binding domain of RSP3 in
 vivo by testing the ability of mutagenized RSP3 to enter the flagellum,
 bind the axoneme, and target fusion proteins to the flagellar compartment.
 To determine how the RSPs and other flagellar proteins are transported to
 their assembly site at the flagellar tip, we will identify the molecular
 motors responsible for a newly-described motility beneath the flagellar
 membrane, IFT (Intraflagellar Transport).  In addition, we will use
 biochemical and genetic procedures, including our probes for RSPs and other
 flagellar proteins, to determine the nature of the cargo being carried by
 these motors.
 
 While investigating motors that may power IFT, we have determined that a
 kinesin-like protein (Klpl), the cDNA of which we have cloned and
 sequenced, is localized to only one of the two central pair microtubules of
 the flagellar axoneme.  We will clone and sequence the other kinesins we
 have identified in Chlamydomonas flagella and localize these proteins with
 specific antibody probes.  Since the central-pair microtubules are thought
 to rotate during flagellar beating, we will examine Klpl motility in vitro
 assays, testing for directionality and the ability to rotate microtubules.
 Proteins that interact with Klpl will be identified by non-denaturing
 immunoprecipitation with the Klpl antibody.  In addition, Klpl cDNAs will
 be mutagenized in vitro, and expressed in Chlamydomonas, to determine the

 copies.  The existence of such multigene families poses several special
 genetic problems  that fall into three overlapping categories.  The first
 relates to the specific role in the cell of each individual gene, the
 second  concerns the exchange of information between copies, while the
 third relates  to the promotion of chromosomal rearrangement through the
 provision of large  homologies.  All three have major implications for
 genome evolution.  This  project addresses these problems through the
 study of an unusual family of composite genetic elements that
 collectively comprise nearly 1% of the  chromosome of Escherichia coli
 K-12.  This Rhs element family is interesting  from several perspectives.
 They serve as paradigms of complex multigene  families which clearly
 interact through recombination.  They are a completely  novel class of
 accessory genetic element whose behavior is still largely not
 understood.  Finally, and possibly most importantly, their novel
 structure and  occurrence in independent E. coli suggest they may have
 a fundamentally  important role in the success of E. coli populations.
 The most prominent  feature of an Rhs element is a large open reading
 frame that encodes a protein  predicted to be in excess of 150 kDa.  This
 large ORF is a mosaic, being  composed of a 3.7 kb core and a shorter
 core-extension.  The cores are highly  conserved among different Rhs
 elements, while the core-extensions are highly  divergent.  The
 association of core-extensions with particular elements varies  in
 independent E. coli in a fashion that correlates with the clonal
 structure  of natural populations.  The degree of this correlation is
 unprecedented among  accessory genetic elements.  Properties predicted
 from the core protein's  primary sequence suggest that this protein may
 function on the cell surface.  The specific aims of the project address
 the functions of these elements, the  control of their expression and
 their genetic behavior in natural populations  of E. coli.

 fundamental questions in contemporary biology.  We propose to address these
 questions by investigation of two highly regulated enzymes of carbohydrate
 metabolism, human brain hexokinase (HKI) and porcine liver fructose-1, 6-
 bisphosphatase (FBPase).  HKI is believed to be the pacemaker of glycolysis
 in brain tissue, whereas FBPase is a crucial control step in
 gluconeogenesis.  Thus these enzymes are related in the sense that one is
 involved in glucose utilization, whereas the other is critical to the
 synthesis of blood glucose.
 
 Brain which only comprises 2-3% of total mammalian body weight utilizes
 approximately 25% of the circulating blood glucose and about 20% of the
 oxygen consumed by the body.  In cerebral tissue, under normal
 physiological conditions, glucose phosphorylation is mediated by HKI, and
 it is then metabolized via the Krebs cycle to synthesize ATP which is
 required in large quantities for brain metabolism.  Human HKI was recently
 cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli in our laboratory.  In order to
 gain insights into the putative glucose and ATP binding domains, the
 regulatory sites, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence responsible for
 HKI binding to the mitochondrial pore structure, studies involving site-
 specific mutagenesis will be undertaken.  NMR spectroscopy will be used in
 conjunction with the mutagenesis experiments to investigate the mechanism
 of the HKI reaction, its molecular mechanism of regulation, and structure-
 function relationships of the enzyme.
 
 The 3-dimensional structure of FBPase is currently available.  Analysis of
 this model can be used to evaluate the structure-function relationships
 that exist at the active and allosteric sites of this enzyme from site-
 specific mutagenesis studies.  We will clone and express the pig kidney
 FBPase gene in E. coli as a prerequisite to doing the site-directed
 mutagenesis studies.  Our goal will be to evaluate the kinetic and
 regulatory properties of the mutant and wild-type enzymes and to use this
 information to elucidate the structure-function relationships of liver
 FBPase.

particular cell strains and mutagenic techniques have been developed
to permit the isolation of lethal as well as nonlethal mutations in
sufficient quantities for analysis.  Structural and functional features
of the mutants will be characterized by a variety of biochemical and
genetic systems.  Four major topics of translation will be
investigated, in each of which rRNA has a central functional role.  The
four areas include I. Fidelity of translation; functional interactions
between tRNA and rRNA.  Mutants will be constructed by site-directed
mutagenesis or selected for by systems such as TrpE91, following random
mutagenesis, to study functional interactions between selected regions
of tRNA and rRNA.  II. Interactions between mRNA and rRNA at initiation

Mutations will be constructed at important functional sites involving
tRNA and rRNA interactions in domain V of 23S rRNA.  IV.  The role of
4.5S rRNA, 16S, and 23S rRNA in transport of nascent proteins across
the cell membrane.  Mutations will be constructed at putative
functional sites in 4.5S rRNA and the rRNAs, and effects on transport
will be studied.  It is anticipated that these studies will contribute
to our understanding of the functional role of rRNA by defining in
detail structural and functional features of particular regions of the

transcriptional regulation. One major project area focusses on the
mechanism for coupling the expression of certain viral genes to DNA
replication during the development of the bacterial virus T4, a process
that is now known to involve transcriptional enhancer mechanisms. The
principal research topics are: 1) the role of DNA connectivity in the
enhancement (i.e. whether enhancing interactions occur in a
three-dimensional space or whether they require tracking along DNA); 2) the
effects of assembling replication proteins into replisome on their ability
to enhance transcription and the effects of ongoing replication on
enhancement; 3) figuring out how transcriptional enhancement works at the
molecular level by mapping protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions at
the promoter and at the enhancer. These four broad topics will be pursued
by various in vitro methods, including transcription kinetics, various
footprinting techniques, photocrosslinking of protein to DNA, other
crosslinking methods and other methods of analyzing the binding of proteins
to DNA in assemblies of moderate complexity. A fourth topic involves
certain in vivo correlates of the preceding analysis.

The second project area consists of several research topics involving
transcription by RNA polymerase III. It is now clear that only one
transcription factor of the yeast RNA polymerase III, TFIIIB, is essential
for positioning the enzyme at the start site for transcription. One
research topic analyzes this minimal transcription initiation system in
kinetic and structural terms, using normal and mutant promoters. A second
research topic involves the use of photochemical methods, including the use
of a newly developed photocrosslinking reagent, to analyze the structure of
transcription complexes and to map protein-protein as well as protein-DNA
interactions along an entire transcription unit. A third research topic
involves kinetic and structural analysis of RNA chain elongation and
termination by RNA polymerase III.

The connecting thread of these two lines of research is their common focus
on a molecular understanding of transcription and its regulation and on
processes such as promoter finding, promoter opening, modulations of
promoter strength by protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, RNA
chain elongation and termination that are common to transcription in all
organisms and all types of cells.

mitotic cell cycle and maintains viability in the presence of intrinsic or
extrinsic perturbations to DNA.  We assume that the RAD9 pathway transduces
a signal from incompletely replicated or damaged DNA to inhibit a component
of the mitotic spindle, the target.  In this project period we seek to:  1)
Identify new checkpoints that we believe to be responsible for enforcing
other dependent relationships in the mitotic cycle and for ensuring the
high fidelity of mitotic chromosome transmission using the logic and
methods developed in our study of the RAD9 pathway.  2) Order that RAD9

pathway by locating the substrate of CDC13, a gene product that acts at a
specific site near the end of the chromosome.  5) Elucidate the pathways of
sister chromatid exchange which occur during cell cycle arrest at the RAD9

 T antigen carries out a number of important and related regulatory
 functions in the course of infection.  Our goals are to understand
 the nature of these functions, to relate these functions to one
 another, and to determine how the structure of T antigen is
 organized to accomplish these functions.  The activities on which
 we focus on this application are the binding of T antigen to the
 origin of replication, the denaturation of origin duplex DNA, the
 role of T antigen in guiding cellular replication proteins to the
 origin, the nicking of origin DNA, and the switch of T antigen from
 initiation to helicase functions in DNA replication.  We think that
 each of these steps in the replication of SV40 may be accomplished
 by distinct functions of T antigen.  This information may establish
 general principles that are applicable to other replicons.  The
 initiation of DNA replication is one of the most perfectly
 regulated processes in eukaryotic cells and is crucial to the
 control of cellular growth.  We have the following specific aims:
 
 1. To characterize further the structure and function of the
 origin of replication.  We will construct insertion mutations
 between domains that we have previously identified to probe the
 spatial relationships among the domains, and we will isolate
 mutations in T antigen that suppress base substitution mutations
 in T antigen-binding regions of the origin to identify protein-DNA
 contact regions.
 
 2. To analyze T antigen-induced events at the origin of
 replication.  We will  use established DNase, DMS and KMn04
 footprinting techniques.  We will also focus on a newly discovered,
 T antigen-associated nuclease activity directed at the AT domain
 of the core origin and on the interactions of T antigen with
 cellular replication proteins.
 
 3. To characterize the domain structure of T antigen.  We will
 use a two-stage saturation mutagenesis of the ""zinc finger"",tsA,
 origin binding, origin unwinding, nuclease-association, and
 helicase domains of T antigen and we will select for second-site
 mutations in T antigen or in the origin of replication that
 suppresses first-site mutations in each functional domain of T
 antigen.

The Hox genes regulate A/P axis patterning from the tail to the hind brain/midbrain junction, while the Dlx genes regulate patterning from the hindbrain to the forebrain.  The Hox and Dlx clusters are linked chromosomally with a one megabase interval separating the two clusters.  The expression of the Hox and Dlx genes is regulated by transcription factors and morphogens such as retinoic acid that bind enhancers and other protein binding sites in non-coding domains within the gene clusters.  The protein binding sites have been shown to exert important cis regulatory control with respect to the orderly activation and display of Hox and Dlx genes over the A/P body and (P/D) limb axes.

In this grant application, we describe our plan to investigate in greater detail the stucture and function of Hox and Dlx cis- regulatory sites.  We will concentrate on two domains with which we have had experience, namely the Hoxc8 (40 kb) and Dlx3/7 (80 kb) regions.  New methods of our design will be used to locate, describe, and mutate control motifs in these domains.  An important new aspect of our research is the identification and functional analysis of transcription factor proteins that bind to control motifs.  We view enhancer elements as the ultimate target of developmental signaling pathways.  The enhancer in its complexity can be viewed as a decoding device to integrate multiple signals and to elicit appropriate gene expression responses in competent cells.  Knowledge regarding enhancer sequence, protein binding domains, and the specific transcription factors binding the enhancers will contribute to our understanding of the epigenetic function of these motifs.  We believe an in depth investigation of non-coding control elements in the Hoxc8 and Dlx3/7 domains will provide insightful information relevant to the entire clusters with respect to their control of developmental patterning and their role in the evolutionary diversification of body plans.",Developmental Regulation of Hox and D1x Gene Expression,,FRANK H RUDDLE,1862461

FBPase levels are elevated in Type 2 diabetics.  Starting from the three-dimensional structures of the T (less active) form and R (more active) forms, attempts are in progress to develop analogues of AMP, the allosteric inhibitor, in order to lower levels of glucose in diabetics.  The stages use cycles of synthesis, structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex by X-ray diffraction, model building and redesign for new synthesis. Inhibitors highly specific for FBPase have been found in the 20nM range for Kd, substantially more strongly bound than AMP (Kd = 1 mu M).  Other aspects of structure-function studies of FBPase include establishing the catalytic and regulatory mechanism, especially the roles of the divalent metal cations. Also, as a result of structure determinations active site inhibitors for allosteric (CMase can be designed as herbicides, bacteriocides or fungicides which are harmless to humans who do not make this enzyme.  Likewise inhibitors of ATCase, such as PALA (N-phosphonyl-L-aspartate) can be improved upon for control of the pyrimidine pathway in certain cancers.  These two regulatory enzymes merit further study, proposed here, in order to understand the structural basis for aspects of allosteric regulation not explainable using the present day models, such as the concerted or sequential models.

Metamorphosis is a remarkably tractable developmental system since the diverse changes can be induced precociously with exogenous TH or inhibited pharmacologically with well known ""goitrogens"" added to the rearing water. Many features of TH physiology are the same in all vertebrates including the negative feedback loop between the thyroid gland the pituitary, the remarkable similarity in the TH receptors (TR), their RCR partners, and the DNA elements (TRE) to which these receptors bind. We have developed a three phase strategy to study individual programs of metamorphosis. First, we identified genes that are up- and down-regulated by TH in the tail, limb, intestine, and a cultured cell by means of a subtractive hybridization method that has the added power of estimating the number of genes in each program. We have concentrated our attention on the simplest program, tail resorption, in which we isolated about half of the TH-induced up- and down-regulated genes (17 and 4, respectively) clues about their possible roles in the resorption program. This grant application deals with the third phase which is underway, namely assaying genes for functional role in metamorphosis. The recent discovery of a transgenesis method for Xenopus laevis has provided us with such an assay. The function of the TH response gene in metamorphoses can be assessed as well as the various receptors, co-activators, and o-repressors that are presumed to play a role in the ability of TH to alter gene expression. Of special interest is an examination of the role of unliganded thyroid receptor in suppressing metamorphic changes. The participation of various hormones other than TH that have been implicated in amphibian metamorphosis is being assessed. The molecular explanation for many well documented biological features of metamorphosis such as the onset of competence to respond to TH, the different chronology of tissue response to the hormone (heterochrony) can be studied from a new perspective. We have already observed instructive phenotypes by over-expressing genes that inhibit metamorphosis.

 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research focuses on enzymes      
 that play central roles in the regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.       
 Metabolite flux through the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways in liver         
 determines the level of serum glucose. Hence, a thorough understanding of          
 regulatory phenomena associated with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis should         
 facilitate the development of new therapies in the treatment of diabetes. The      
 goal here is a complete description of the dynamics of ligand interactions and     
 the molecular mechanisms of catalytic/regulatory actions associated with human     
 hexokinase I and porcine fructose-i 6-bisphosphatase. Hexokinase I is broadly      
 distributed amongst tissues, and is the predominant isoform in the brain and       
 the red blood cell. The isoform of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase under               
 investigation here predominates in liver. An engineered form of hexokinase I       
 will permit the determination by NMR spectroscopy of the equilibrium constant      
 governing its central kinetic complex. Specific mutants at ligand binding sites    
 should reveal key factors governing interactions between hexokinase I and the      
 mitochondrion. A proposed model for the allosteric regulation of catalysis in      
 hexokinase I will be tested by directed mutation. Predicted outcomes of            
 specific mutations will be verified by steady-state kinetics and structure         
 determinations by X-ray diffraction. Novel constructs of fructose-I                
 ,6-bisphosphatase, which combine subunits of different functional properties       
 into a single tetramer, should reveal the basis of cooperative phenomena in        
 ligand binding and kinetics. Stopped-flow fluorescence of an engineered            
 fructose-1 ,6-bisphosphatase should determine whether the enzyme under             
 conditions of kinetics assays exists in an oligomeric state other than that of     
 a tetramer. Molecular models for allosteric inhibition, ligand binding             
 synergism, and catalysis proposed for fructose-1 ,6-bisphosphatase will be         
 tested by directed mutations and follow-up investigations in fluorescence          
 spectroscopy, steady state kinetics, NMR spectroscopy and structure                
 determinations from single crystals. Finally, the significance and                 
 physiological relevance of a newly discovered allosteric effector site on          
 fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase will be investigated by techniques of steady-state
